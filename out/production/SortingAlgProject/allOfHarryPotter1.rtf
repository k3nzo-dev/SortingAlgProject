THE BOY WHO LIVED \
\
Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, \
were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, \
thank you very much. They were the last people you\'92d \
expect to be involved in anything strange or \
mysterious, because they just didn\'92t hold with such \
nonsense. \
\
Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called \
Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy \
man with hardly any neck, although he did have a \
very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and \
blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of \
neck, which came in very useful as she spent so \
much of her time craning over garden fences, spying \
on the neighbors. The Dursley s had a small son \
called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer \
boy anywhere. \
\
The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they \
also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that \
somebody would discover it. They didn\'92t think they \
could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. \
Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley\'92s sister, but they hadn\'92t \
\

\
\
\
met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended \
she didn\'92t have a sister, because her sister and her \
good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it \
was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think \
what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in \
the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a \
small son, too, but they had never even seen him. \
\
This boy was another good reason for keeping the \
Potters away; they didn\'92t want Dudley mixing with a \
child like that. \
\
When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray \
Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the \
cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and \
mysterious things would soon be happening all over \
the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out \
his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley \
gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming \
Dudley into his high chair. \
\
None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past \
the window. \
\
At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his \
briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and \
tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because \
Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his \
cereal at the walls. \'93Little tyke,\'94 chortled Mr. Dursley \
as he left the house. He got into his car and backed \
out of number four\'92s drive. \
\
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the \
first sign of something peculiar \'97 a cat reading a \
map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn\'92t realize what he \
had seen \'97 then he jerked his head around to look \
again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner \
of Privet Drive, but there wasn\'92t a map in sight. What \
could he have been thinking of? It must have been a \
trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at \
Page | 3 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around \
the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his \
mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet \
Drive \'97 no, looking at the sign; cats couldn\'92t read \
maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake \
and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward \
town he thought of nothing except a large order of \
drills he was hoping to get that day. \
\
But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his \
mind by something else. As he sat in the usual \
morning traffic jam, he couldn\'92t help noticing that \
there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people \
about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn\'92t bear \
people who dressed in funny clothes \'97 the getups \
you saw on young people! He supposed this was some \
stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the \
steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these \
weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering \
excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see \
that a couple of them weren\'92t young at all; why, that \
man had to be older than he was, and wearing an \
emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it \
struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly \
stunt \'97 these people were obviously collecting for \
something ... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved \
on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the \
Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. \
\
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in \
his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn\'92t, he might \
have found it harder to concentrate on drills that \
morning. He didn\'92t see the owls swooping past in \
broad daylight, though people down in the street did; \
they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after \
owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an \
owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a \
perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five \
different people. He made several important telephone \
Page | 4 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good \
mood until lunchtime, when he thought he\'92d stretch \
his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a \
bun from the bakery. \
\
He\'92d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he \
passed a group of them next to the baker\'92s. He eyed \
them angrily as he passed. He didn\'92t know why, but \
they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering \
excitedly, too, and he couldn\'92t see a single collecting \
tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a \
large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words \
of what they were saying. \
\
\'93The Potters, that\'92s right, that\'92s what I heard \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93 \'97 yes, their son, Harry \'97 \'94 \
\
Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He \
looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say \
something to them, but thought better of it. \
\
He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his \
office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, \
seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing \
his home number when he changed his mind. He put \
the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, \
thinking ... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn\'92t \
such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots \
of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. \
Come to think of it, he wasn\'92t even sure his nephew \
was called Harry. He\'92d never even seen the boy. It \
might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no \
point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so \
upset at any mention of her sister. He didn\'92t blame \
her \'97 if he\'92d had a sister like that ... but all the \
same, those people in cloaks ... \
\
\
\

\
\
\
\
He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that \
afternoon and when he left the building at five o\'92clock, \
he was still so worried that he walked straight into \
someone just outside the door. \
\
\'93Sorry,\'94 he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled \
and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. \
Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet \
cloak. He didn\'92t seem at all upset at being almost \
knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split \
into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that \
made passersby stare, \'93Don\'92t be sorry, my dear sir, \
for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You- \
Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like \
yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy \
day!\'94 \
\
And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the \
middle and walked off. \
\
Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been \
hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he \
had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was \
rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, \
hoping he was imagining things, which he had never \
hoped before, because he didn\'92t approve of \
imagination. \
\
As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the \
first thing he saw \'97 and it didn\'92t improve his mood \'97 \
was the tabby cat he\'92d spotted that morning. It was \
now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the \
same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. \
\
\'93Shoo!\'94 said Mr. Dursley loudly. \
\
The cat didn\'92t move. It just gave him a stern look. \
\
Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. \
Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the \
\
Page | 6 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
house. He was still determined not to mention \
anything to his wife. \
\
Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told \
him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door\'92s problems \
with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new \
word (\'93Won\'92t!\'94). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. \
When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the \
living room in time to catch the last report on the \
evening news: \
\
\'93And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported \
that the nation\'92s owls have been behaving very \
unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at \
night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have \
been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in \
every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to \
explain why the owls have suddenly changed their \
sleeping pattern.\'94 The newscaster allowed himself a \
grin. \'93Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim \
McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more \
showers of owls tonight, Jim?\'94 \
\
\'93Well, Ted,\'94 said the weatherman, \'93I don\'92t know about \
that, but it\'92s not only the owls that have been acting \
oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, \
and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that \
instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they\'92ve had a \
downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have \
been celebrating Bonfire Night early \'97 it\'92s not until \
next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night \
tonight.\'94 \
\
Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars \
all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious \
people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a \
whisper about the Potters . . . \
\
\
\
Page | 7 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two \
cups of tea. It was no good. He\'92d have to say \
something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \'93Er \
\'97 Petunia, dear \'97 you haven\'92t heard from your sister \
lately, have you?\'94 \
\
As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and \
angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn\'92t \
have a sister. \
\
\'93No,\'94 she said sharply. \'93Why?\'94 \
\
\'93Funny stuff on the news,\'94 Mr. Dursley mumbled. \
\'93Owls . . . shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of \
funny-looking people in town today ...\'94 \
\
\'93So?\'94 snapped Mrs. Dursley. \
\
\'93Well, I just thought ... maybe ... it was something to \
do with ... you know ... her crowd.\'94 \
\
Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. \
Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he\'92d \
heard the name \'93Potter.\'94 He decided he didn\'92t dare. \
Instead he said, as casually as he could, \'93Their son \'97 \
he\'92d be about Dudley\'92s age now, wouldn\'92t he?\'94 \
\
\'93I suppose so,\'94 said Mrs. Dursley stiffly. \
\
\'93What\'92s his name again? Howard, isn\'92t it?\'94 \
\
\'93Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\'94 \
\
\'93Oh, yes,\'94 said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking \
horribly. \'93Yes, I quite agree.\'94 \
\
He didn\'92t say another word on the subject as they \
went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the \
bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window \
\
Page | 8 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
and peered down into the front garden. The cat was \
still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though \
it were waiting for something. \
\
Was he imagining things? Could all this have \
anything to do with the Potters? If it did ... if it got out \
that they were related to a pair of \'97 well, he didn\'92t \
think he could bear it. \
\
The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep \
quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over \
in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell \
asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, \
there was no reason for them to come near him and \
Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and \
Petunia thought about them and their kind. ... He \
couldn\'92t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up \
in anything that might be going on \'97 he yawned and \
turned over \'97 it couldn\'92t affect them. ... \
\
How very wrong he was. \
\
Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy \
sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no \
sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, \
its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet \
Drive. It didn\'92t so much as quiver when a car door \
slammed on the next street, nor when two owls \
swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight \
before the cat moved at all. \
\
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been \
watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you\'92d \
have thought he\'92d just popped out of the ground. The \
cat\'92s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. \
\
Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet \
Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the \
silver of his hair and beard, which were both long \
\
Page | 9 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long \
robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and \
high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, \
bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles \
and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it \
had been broken at least twice. This man\'92s name was \
Albus Dumbledore. \
\
Albus Dumbledore didn\'92t seem to realize that he had \
just arrived in a street where everything from his \
name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy \
rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But \
he did seem to realize he was being watched, because \
he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still \
staring at him from the other end of the street. For \
some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse \
him. He chuckled and muttered, \'93I should have \
known.\'94 \
\
He found what he was looking for in his inside \
pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He \
flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. \
The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He \
clicked it again \'97 the next lamp flickered into \
darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, \
until the only lights left on the whole street were two \
tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of \
the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their \
window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they \
wouldn\'92t be able to see anything that was happening \
down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put- \
Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the \
street toward number four, where he sat down on the \
wall next to the cat. He didn\'92t look at it, but after a \
moment he spoke to it. \
\
\'93Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 10 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. \
Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking \
woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the \
shape of the markings the cat had had around its \
eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. \
Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She \
looked distinctly ruffled. \
\
\'93How did you know it was me?\'94 she asked. \
\
\'93My dear Professor, I\'92ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\'94 \
\
\'93You\'92d be stiff if you\'92d been sitting on a brick wall all \
day,\'94 said Professor McGonagall. \
\
\'93All day? When you could have been celebrating? I \
must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my \
way here.\'94 \
\
Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily. \
\
\'93Oh yes, everyone\'92s celebrating, all right,\'94 she said \
impatiently. \'93You\'92d think they\'92d be a bit more careful, \
but no \'97 even the Muggles have noticed something\'92s \
going on. It was on their news.\'94 She jerked her head \
back at the Dursleys\'92 dark living-room window. \'93I \
heard it. Flocks of owls ... shooting stars. ... Well, \
they\'92re not completely stupid. They were bound to \
notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent \'97 I\'92ll \
bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much \
sense.\'94 \
\
\'93You can\'92t blame them,\'94 said Dumbledore gently. \
\'93We\'92ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven \
years.\'94 \
\
\'93I know that,\'94 said Professor McGonagall irritably. \
\
\'93But that\'92s no reason to lose our heads. People are \
being downright careless, out on the streets in broad \
\
Page | 11 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, \
swapping rumors.\'94 \
\
She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore \
here, as though hoping he was going to tell her \
something, but he didn\'92t, so she went on. \'93A fine \
thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who \
seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found \
out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, \
Dumbledore?\'94 \
\
\'93It certainly seems so,\'94 said Dumbledore. \'93We have \
much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon \
drop?\'94 \
\
\'93A what?\'94 \
\
\'93A lemon drop. They\'92re a kind of Muggle sweet I\'92m \
rather fond of.\'94 \
\
\'93No, thank you,\'94 said Professor McGonagall coldly, as \
though she didn\'92t think this was the moment for \
lemon drops. \'93As I say, even if You-Know-Who has \
gone \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like \
yourself can call him by his name? All this You- \
Know-Who\'92 nonsense \'97 for eleven years I have been \
trying to persuade people to call him by his proper \
name: Voldemort.\'94 Professor McGonagall flinched, but \
Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, \
seemed not to notice. \'93It all gets so confusing if we \
keep saying You-Know-Who.\'92 I have never seen any \
reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort\'92s name.\'94 \
\
\'93I know you haven\'92t,\'94 said Professor McGonagall, \
sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \'93But you\'92re \
different. Everyone knows you\'92re the only one You- \
Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\'94 \
\
Page | 12 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93You flatter me,\'94 said Dumbledore calmly. \'93Voldemort \
had powers I will never have.\'94 \
\
\
\
\'93Only because you\'92re too \'97 well \'97 noble to use \
them.\'94 \
\
\'93It\'92s lucky it\'92s dark. I haven\'92t blushed so much since \
Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\'94 \
\
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at \
Dumbledore and said, \'93The owls are nothing next to \
the rumors that are flying around. You know what \
everyone\'92s saying? About why he\'92s disappeared? \
\
About what finally stopped him?\'94 \
\
It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the \
point she was most anxious to discuss, the real \
reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all \
day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she \
fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she \
did now. It was plain that whatever \'93everyone\'94 was \
saying, she was not going to believe it until \
Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, \
however, was choosing another lemon drop and did \
not answer. \
\
\'93What they\'92re saying,\'94 she pressed on, \'93is that last \
night Voldemort turned up in Godric\'92s Hollow. He \
went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and \
James Potter are \'97 are \'97 that they\'92re \'97 dead.\'94 \
\
Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall \
gasped. \
\
\'93Lily and James ... I can\'92t believe it ... I didn\'92t want to \
believe it ... Oh, Albus ...\'94 \
\
Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the \
shoulder. \'93I know ... I know ...\'94 he said heavily. \
\
Page | 13 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Professor McGonagall\'92s voice trembled as she went \
on. \'93That\'92s not all. They\'92re saying he tried to kill the \
Potters\'92 son, Harry. But \'97 he couldn\'92t. He couldn\'92t \
kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but \
they\'92re saying that when he couldn\'92t kill Harry Potter, \
Voldemort\'92s power somehow broke \'97 and that\'92s why \
he\'92s gone.\'94 \
\
Dumbledore nodded glumly. \
\
\'93It\'92s \'97 it\'92s true?\'94 faltered Professor McGonagall. \'93After \
all he\'92s done ... all the people he\'92s killed ... he couldn\'92t \
kill a little boy? It\'92s just astounding ... of all the \
things to stop him . . . but how in the name of heaven \
did Harry survive?\'94 \
\
\'93We can only guess,\'94 said Dumbledore. \'93We may \
never know.\'94 \
\
Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief \
and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. \
Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden \
watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very \
odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; \
instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It \
must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, \
because he put it back in his pocket and said, \
\'93Hagrid\'92s late. I suppose it was he who told you I\'92d be \
here, by the way?\'94 \
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said Professor McGonagall. \'93And I don\'92t \
suppose you\'92re going to tell me why you\'92re here, of all \
places?\'94 \
\
\'93I\'92ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. \
They\'92re the only family he has left now.\'94 \
\
\'93You don\'92t mean \'97 you can\'92t mean the people who \
live here?\'94 cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her \
\
Page | 14 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
feet and pointing at number four. \'93Dumbledore \'97 you \
can\'92t. I\'92ve been watching them all day. You couldn\'92t \
find two people who are less like us. And they\'92ve got \
this son \'97 I saw him kicking his mother all the way \
up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter \
come and live here!\'94 \
\
\'93It\'92s the best place for him,\'94 said Dumbledore firmly. \
\'93His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything \
to him when he\'92s older. I\'92ve written them a letter.\'94 \
\
\'93A letter?\'94 repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, \
sitting back down on the wall. \'93Really, Dumbledore, \
you think you can explain all this in a letter? These \
people will never understand him! He\'92ll be famous \'97 \
a legend \'97 I wouldn\'92t be surprised if today was \
known as Harry Potter Day in the future \'97 there will \
be books written about Harry \'97 every child in our \
world will know his name!\'94 \
\
\'93Exactly,\'94 said Dumbledore, looking very seriously \
over the top of his half-moon glasses. \'93It would be \
enough to turn any boy\'92s head. Famous before he can \
walk and talk! Famous for something he won\'92t even \
remember! Can\'92t you see how much better off he\'92ll be, \
growing up away from all that until he\'92s ready to take \
it?\'94 \
\
\
\
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her \
mind, swallowed, and then said, \'93Yes \'97 yes, you\'92re \
right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, \
Dumbledore?\'94 She eyed his cloak suddenly as though \
she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it. \
\
\'93Hagrid\'92s bringing him.\'94 \
\
\'93You think it \'97 wise \'97 to trust Hagrid with \
something as important as this?\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 15 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93I would trust Hagrid with my life,\'94 said Dumbledore. \
\
\'93I\'92m not saying his heart isn\'92t in the right place,\'94 said \
Professor McGonagall grudgingly, \'93but you can\'92t \
pretend he\'92s not careless. He does tend to \'97 what \
was that?\'94 \
\
A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around \
them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and \
down the street for some sign of a headlight; it \
swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky \'97 \
and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed \
on the road in front of them. \
\
If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man \
sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a \
normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked \
simply too big to be allowed, and so wild \'97 long \
tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his \
face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his \
feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In \
his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of \
blankets. \
\
\'93Hagrid,\'94 said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \'93At \
last. And where did you get that motorcycle?\'94 \
\
\'93Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\'94 said the \
giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he \
spoke. \'93Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I\'92ve got him, \
sir.\'94 \
\
\'93No problems, were there?\'94 \
\
\'93No, sir \'97 house was almost destroyed, but I got him \
out all right before the Muggles started swarmin\'92 \
around. He fell asleep as we was flyin\'92 over Bristol.\'94 \
\
\
\

\
\
\
\
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward \
over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a \
baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair \
over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped \
cut, like a bolt of lightning. \
\
\'93Is that where \'97 ?\'94 whispered Professor McGonagall. \
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said Dumbledore. \'93Hell have that scar forever.\'94 \
\
\'93Couldn\'92t you do something about it, Dumbledore?\'94 \
\
\'93Even if I could, I wouldn\'92t. Scars can come in handy. \
\
I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect \
map of the London Underground. Well \'97 give him \
here, Hagrid \'97 we\'92d better get this over with.\'94 \
\
Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned \
toward the Dursleys\'92 house. \
\
\'93Could I \'97 could I say good-bye to him, sir?\'94 asked \
Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry \
and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, \
whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl \
like a wounded dog. \
\
\'93Shhh!\'94 hissed Professor McGonagall, \'93you\'92ll wake the \
Muggles!\'94 \
\
\'93S-s-sorry,\'94 sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted \
handkerchief and burying his face in it. \'93But I c-c- \
can\'92t stand it \'97 Lily an\'92 James dead \'97 an\'92 poor little \
Harry off ter live with Muggles \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Yes, yes, it\'92s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, \
Hagrid, or we\'92ll be found,\'94 Professor McGonagall \
whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as \
Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and \
walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the \
Page | 17 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it \
inside Harry\'92s blankets, and then came back to the \
other two. For a full minute the three of them stood \
and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid\'92s shoulders \
shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and \
the twinkling light that usually shone from \
Dumbledore\'92s eyes seemed to have gone out. \
\
\'93Well,\'94 said Dumbledore finally, \'93that\'92s that. We\'92ve no \
business staying here. We may as well go and join the \
celebrations.\'94 \
\
\'93Yeah,\'94 said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \'93I\'92d best \
get this bike away. G \'92night, Professor McGonagall \'97 \
Professor Dumbledore, sir.\'94 \
\
Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid \
swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the \
engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off \
into the night. \
\
\'93I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\'94 \
said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor \
McGonagall blew her nose in reply. \
\
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. \
On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put- \
Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light \
sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive \
glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a \
tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end \
of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets \
on the step of number four. \
\
\'93Good luck, Harry,\'94 he murmured. He turned on his \
heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. \
\
A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which \
lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last \
\
Page | 18 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
place you would expect astonishing things to happen. \
Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without \
waking up. One small hand closed on the letter \
beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was \
special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he \
would be woken in a few hours\'92 time by Mrs. \
\
Dursley\'92s scream as she opened the front door to put \
out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next \
few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin \
Dudley. ... He couldn\'92t know that at this very \
moment, people meeting in secret all over the country \
were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed \
voices: \'93To Harry Potter \'97 the boy who lived!\'94 \
\

THE VANASHIG GLASS \
\
Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had \
woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but \
Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose \
on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass \
number four on the Dursleys\'92 front door; it crept into \
their living room, which was almost exactly the same \
as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had \
seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the \
photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how \
much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been \
lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach \
ball wearing different-colored bonnets \'97 but Dudley \
Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the \
photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first \
bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer \
game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his \
mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy \
lived in the house, too. \
\
Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, \
but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it \
\
\
\
Page | 20 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the \
day. \
\
\'93Up! Get up! Now!\'94 \
\
Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door \
again. \
\
\'93Up!\'94 she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward \
the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan \
being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and \
tried to remember the dream he had been having. It \
had been a good one. There had been a flying \
motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he\'92d had the \
same dream before. \
\
His aunt was back outside the door. \
\
\'93Are you up yet?\'94 she demanded. \
\
\'93Nearly,\'94 said Harry. \
\
\'93Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the \
bacon. And don\'92t you dare let it burn, I want \
everything perfect on Duddy\'92s birthday.\'94 \
\
Harry groaned. \
\
\'93What did you say?\'94 his aunt snapped through the \
door. \
\
\'93Nothing, nothing ...\'94 \
\
Dudley\'92s birthday \'97 how could he have forgotten? \
Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for \
socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after \
pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry \
was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the \
stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. \
Page | 21 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
When he was dressed he went down the hall into the \
kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all \
Dudley\'92s birthday presents. It looked as though \
Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not \
to mention the second television and the racing bike. \
Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a \
mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated \
exercise \'97 unless of course it involved punching \
somebody. Dudley\'92s favorite punching bag was Harry, \
but he couldn\'92t often catch him. Harry didn\'92t look it, \
but he was very fast. \
\
Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark \
cupboard, but Harry had always been small and \
skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and \
skinnier than he really was because all he had to \
wear were old clothes of Dudley\'92s, and Dudley was \
about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin \
face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green \
eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot \
of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had \
punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked \
about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his \
forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He \
had had it as long as he could remember, and the \
first question he could ever remember asking his \
Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. \
\
\'93In the car crash when your parents died,\'94 she had \
said. \'93And don\'92t ask questions.\'94 \
\
Don\'92t ask questions \'97 that was the first rule for a \
quiet life with the Dursleys. \
\
Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was \
turning over the bacon. \
\
\'93Comb your hair!\'94 he barked, by way of a morning \
greeting. \
\
Page | 22 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top \
of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a \
haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the \
rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made \
no difference, his hair simply grew that way \'97 all over \
the place. \
\
Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in \
the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like \
Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much \
neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair \
that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia \
often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel \'97 \
Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a \
wig. \
\
Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, \
which was difficult as there wasn\'92t much room. \
Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His \
face fell. \
\
\'93Thirty-six,\'94 he said, looking up at his mother and \
father. \'93That\'92s two less than last year.\'94 \
\
\'93Darling, you haven\'92t counted Auntie Marge\'92s present, \
see, it\'92s here under this big one from Mommy and \
Daddy.\'94 \
\
\'93All right, thirty-seven then,\'94 said Dudley, going red \
in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley \
tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as \
fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. \
\
Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because \
she said quickly, \'93And we\'92ll buy you another two \
presents while we\'92re out today. How\'92s that, popkin? \
Two more presents. Is that all right?\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 23 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard \
work. Finally he said slowly, \'93So I\'92ll have thirty ... \
thirty ...\'94 \
\
\'93Thirty-nine, sweetums,\'94 said Aunt Petunia. \
\
\'93Oh.\'94 Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the \
nearest parcel. \'93All right then.\'94 \
\
Uncle Vernon chuckled. \
\
\'93Little tyke wants his money\'92s worth, just like his \
father. \'92Atta boy, Dudley!\'94 He ruffled Dudley\'92s hair. \
\
At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia \
went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon \
watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video \
camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new \
computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the \
paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came \
back from the telephone looking both angry and \
worried. \
\
\'93Bad news, Vernon,\'94 she said. \'93Mrs. Figg\'92s broken her \
leg. She can\'92t take him.\'94 She jerked her head in \
Harry\'92s direction. \
\
Dudley\'92s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry\'92s heart \
gave a leap. Every year on Dudley\'92s birthday, his \
parents took him and a friend out for the day, to \
adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the \
movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. \
Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. \
\
Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of \
cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs \
of all the cats she\'92d ever owned. \
\
\'93Now what?\'94 said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at \
Harry as though he\'92d planned this. Harry knew he \
\
Page | 24 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, \
but it wasn\'92t easy when he reminded himself it would \
be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies, \
Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. \
\
\'93We could phone Marge,\'94 Uncle Vernon suggested. \
\
\'93Don\'92t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\'94 \
\
The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as \
though he wasn\'92t there \'97 or rather, as though he was \
something very nasty that couldn\'92t understand them, \
like a slug. \
\
\'93What about what\'92s-her-name, your friend \'97 \
Yvonne?\'94 \
\
\'93On vacation in Majorca,\'94 snapped Aunt Petunia. \
\
\'93You could just leave me here,\'94 Harry put in hopefully \
(he\'92d be able to watch what he wanted on television \
for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley\'92s \
computer) . \
\
Aunt Petunia looked as though she\'92d just swallowed a \
lemon. \
\
\'93And come back and find the house in ruins?\'94 she \
snarled. \
\
\'93I won\'92t blow up the house,\'94 said Harry, but they \
weren\'92t listening. \
\
\'93I suppose we could take him to the zoo,\'94 said Aunt \
Petunia slowly, "... and leave him in the car. ...\'94 \
\
\'93That cars new, he\'92s not sitting in it alone. ...\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 25 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn\'92t really \
crying \'97 it had been years since he\'92d really cried \'97 \
but he knew that if he screwed up his face and \
wailed, his mother would give him anything he \
wanted. \
\
\'93Dinky Duddydums, don\'92t cry, Mummy won\'92t let him \
spoil your special day!\'94 she cried, flinging her arms \
around him. \
\
\'93I ... don\'92t ... want ... him ... t-t-to come!\'94 Dudley \
yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \'93He always sp- \
spoils everything!\'94 He shot Harry a nasty grin through \
the gap in his mothers arms. \
\
Just then, the doorbell rang \'97 \'93Oh, good Lord, \
they\'92re here!\'94 said Aunt Petunia frantically \'97 and a \
moment later, Dudley\'92s best friend, Piers Polkiss, \
walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy \
with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who \
held people\'92s arms behind their backs while Dudley \
hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. \
\
Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn\'92t believe his \
luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys\'92 car with \
Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first \
time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn\'92t been able \
to think of anything else to do with him, but before \
they\'92d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. \
\
\'93I\'92m warning you,\'94 he had said, putting his large \
purple face right up close to Harry\'92s, \'93I\'92m warning you \
now, boy \'97 any funny business, anything at all \'97 \
and you\'92ll be in that cupboard from now until \
Christmas.\'94 \
\
I\'92m not going to do anything,\'94 said Harry, \'93honestly \
\
\
\
Page | 26 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
But Uncle Vernon didn\'92t believe him. No one ever did. \
\
\
\
The problem was, strange things often happened \
around Harry and it was just no good telling the \
Dursleys he didn\'92t make them happen. \
\
Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from \
the barbers looking as though he hadn\'92t been at all, \
had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair \
so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, \
which she left \'93to hide that horrible scar.\'94 Dudley had \
laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless \
night imagining school the next day, where he was \
already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped \
glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to \
find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt \
Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week \
in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to \
explain that he couldn\'92t explain how it had grown \
back so quickly. \
\
Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force \
him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley\'92s (brown \
with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it \
over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until \
finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but \
certainly wouldn\'92t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided \
it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great \
relief, Harry wasn\'92t punished. \
\
On the other hand, he\'92d gotten into terrible trouble \
for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. \
Dudley\'92s gang had been chasing him as usual when, \
as much to Harry\'92s surprise as anyone else\'92s, there he \
was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had \
received a very angry letter from Harry\'92s headmistress \
telling them Harry had been climbing school \
buildings. But all he\'92d tried to do (as he shouted at \
Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his \
Page | 27 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans \
outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the \
wind must have caught him in mid-jump. \
\
But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even \
worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the \
day somewhere that wasn\'92t school, his cupboard, or \
Mrs. Figg\'92s cabbage-smelling living room. \
\
While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt \
Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at \
work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry \
were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, \
it was motorcycles. \
\
"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\'94 \
he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. \
\
\'93I had a dream about a motorcycle,\'94 said Harry, \
remembering suddenly. \'93It was flying.\'94 \
\
Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He \
turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, \
his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \
\'93MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!\'94 \
\
Dudley and Piers sniggered. \
\
\'93I know they don\'92t,\'94 said Harry. \'93It was only a dream.\'94 \
\
But he wished he hadn\'92t said anything. If there was \
one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his \
asking questions, it was his talking about anything \
acting in a way it shouldn\'92t, no matter if it was in a \
dream or even a cartoon \'97 they seemed to think he \
might get dangerous ideas. \
\
It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was \
crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley \
\
Page | 28 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance \
and then, because the smiling lady in the van had \
asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry \
him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It \
wasn\'92t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they \
watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked \
remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn\'92t blond. \
\
Harry had the best morning he\'92d had in a long time. \
He was careful to walk a little way apart from the \
Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting \
to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn\'92t \
fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They \
ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a \
tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn\'92t have \
enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him \
another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. \
\
Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it \
was all too good to last. \
\
After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool \
and dark in there, with lit windows all along the \
walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes \
were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and \
stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, \
poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. \
Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It \
could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle \
Vernon\'92s car and crushed it into a trash can \'97 but at \
the moment it didn\'92t look in the mood. In fact, it was \
fast asleep. \
\
Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, \
staring at the glistening brown coils. \
\
\'93Make it move,\'94 he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon \
tapped on the glass, but the snake didn\'92t budge. \
\
\
\
Page | 29 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Do it again,\'94 Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped \
the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake \
just snoozed on. \
\
\'93This is boring,\'94 Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. \
\
Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently \
at the snake. He wouldn\'92t have been surprised if it \
had died of boredom itself \'97 no company except \
stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass \
trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than \
having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only \
visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to \
wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the \
house. \
\
The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, \
very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a \
level with Harry\'92s. \
\
It winked. \
\
Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if \
anyone was watching. They weren\'92t. He looked back \
at the snake and winked, too. \
\
The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and \
Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave \
Harry a look that said quite plainly: \
\
\'93I get that all the time.\'94 \
\
\'93I know,\'94 Harry murmured through the glass, though \
he wasn\'92t sure the snake could hear him. \'93It must be \
really annoying.\'94 \
\
The snake nodded vigorously. \
\
\'93Where do you come from, anyway?\'94 Harry asked. \
\
Page | 30 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the \
glass. Harry peered at it. \
\
Boa Constrictor, Brazil. \
\
\'93Was it nice there?\'94 \
\
The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again \
and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the \
zoo. \'93Oh, I see \'97 so you\'92ve never been to Brazil?\'94 \
\
As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout \
behind Harry made both of them jump. \'93DUDLEY! \
MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! \
YOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT IT\'92S DOING!\'94 \
\
Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he \
could. \
\
\'93Out of the way, you,\'94 he said, punching Harry in the \
ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the \
concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no \
one saw how it happened \'97 one second, Piers and \
Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the \
next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. \
\
Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa \
constrictor\'92s tank had vanished. The great snake was \
uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. \
People throughout the reptile house screamed and \
started running for the exits. \
\
As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have \
sworn a low, hissing voice said, \'93Brazil, here I come. \
... Thanksss, amigo.\'94 \
\
The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. \
\
\
\
Page | 31 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93But the glass,\'94 he kept saying, \'93where did the glass \
go?\'94 " \
\
The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of \
strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over \
again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as \
Harry had seen, the snake hadn\'92t done anything \
except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but \
by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon\'92s car, \
Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off \
his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to \
squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at \
least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \'93Harry \
was talking to it, weren\'92t you, Harry?\'94 \
\
Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the \
house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he \
could hardly speak. He managed to say, \'93Go \'97 \
cupboard \'97 stay \'97 no meals,\'94 before he collapsed \
into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get \
him a large brandy. \
\
Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing \
he had a watch. He didn\'92t know what time it was and \
he couldn\'92t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. \
\
Until they were, he couldn\'92t risk sneaking to the \
kitchen for some food. \
\
He\'92d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten \
miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever \
since he\'92d been a baby and his parents had died in \
that car crash. He couldn\'92t remember being in the car \
when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he \
strained his memory during long hours in his \
cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a \
blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his \
forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though \
he couldn\'92t imagine where all the green light came \
from. He couldn\'92t remember his parents at all. His \

\
\
\
aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of \
course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were \
no photographs of them in the house. \
\
When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and \
dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take \
him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys \
were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or \
maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to \
know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A \
tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once \
while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. \
After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt \
Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without \
buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed \
all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. \
\
A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually \
shaken his hand in the street the other day and then \
walked away without a word. The weirdest thing \
about all these people was the way they seemed to \
vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look. \
\
At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that \
Dudley\'92s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his \
baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody \
liked to disagree with Dudley\'92s gang. \

\
THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE \
\
The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned \
Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he \
was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer \
holidays had started and Dudley had already broken \
his new video camera, crashed his remote control \
airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, \
knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet \
Drive on her crutches. \
\
Harry was glad school was over, but there was no \
escaping Dudley\'92s gang, who visited the house every \
single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were \
all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and \
stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of \
them were all quite happy to join in Dudley\'92s favorite \
sport: Harry Hunting. \
\
This was why Harry spent as much time as possible \
out of the house, wandering around and thinking \
about the end of the holidays, where he could see a \
tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be \
going off to secondary school and, for the first time in \
Page | 34 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
his life, he wouldn\'92t be with Dudley. Dudley had been \
accepted at Uncle Vernon\'92s old private school, \
Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, \
on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the \
local public school. Dudley thought this was very \
funny. \
\
\'93They stuff people\'92s heads down the toilet the first day \
at Stonewall,\'94 he told Harry. \'93Want to come upstairs \
and practice?\'94 \
\
\'93No, thanks,\'94 said Harry. \'93The poor toilet\'92s never had \
anything as horrible as your head down it \'97 it might \
be sick.\'94 Then he ran, before Dudley could work out \
what he\'92d said. \
\
One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London \
to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. \
Figg\'92s. Mrs. Figg wasn\'92t as bad as usual. It turned out \
she\'92d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and \
she didn\'92t seem quite as fond of them as before. She \
let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of \
chocolate cake that tasted as though she\'92d had it for \
several years. \
\
That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room \
for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings \
boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, \
and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried \
knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the \
teachers weren\'92t looking. This was supposed to be \
good training for later life. \
\
As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, \
Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest \
moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and \
said she couldn\'92t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, \
he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn\'92t \
\
\
\

\
\
\
\
trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs \
might already have cracked from trying not to laugh. \
\
\
\
k k k \
\
\
\
There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next \
morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed \
to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He \
went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked \
like dirty rags swimming in gray water. \
\
\'93What\'92s this?\'94 he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips \
tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a \
question. \
\
\'93Your new school uniform,\'94 she said. \
\
Harry looked in the bowl again. \
\
\'93Oh,\'94 he said, \'93I didn\'92t realize it had to be so wet.\'94 \
\
\'93Don\'92t be stupid,\'94 snapped Aunt Petunia. \'93I\'92m dyeing \
some of Dudley\'92s old things gray for you. It\'92ll look just \
like everyone else\'92s when I\'92ve finished.\'94 \
\
Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not \
to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to \
think about how he was going to look on his first day \
at Stonewall High \'97 like he was wearing bits of old \
elephant skin, probably. \
\
Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with \
wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry\'92s new \
uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as \
usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which \
he carried everywhere, on the table. \
\
They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters \
on the doormat. \
\
Page | 36 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Get the mail, Dudley,\'94 said Uncle Vernon from \
behind his paper. \
\
\'93Make Harry get it.\'94 \
\
\'93Get the mail, Harry.\'94 \
\
\'93Make Dudley get it.\'94 \
\
\'93Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\'94 \
\
Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the \
mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard \
from Uncle Vernon\'92s sister Marge, who was \
vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope \
that looked like a bill, and \'97 a letter for Harry. \
\
Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging \
like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole \
life, had written to him. Who would? He had no \
friends, no other relatives \'97 he didn\'92t belong to the \
library, so he\'92d never even got rude notes asking for \
books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so \
plainly there could be no mistake: \
\
Mr. H. Potter \
\
The Cupboard under the Stairs \
4 Privet Drive \
Little Whinging \
Surrey \
\
The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish \
parchment, and the address was written in emerald- \
green ink. There was no stamp. \
\
\
\
Page | 37 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry \
saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, \
an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large \
letter H. \
\
\'93Hurry up, boy!\'94 shouted Uncle Vernon from the \
kitchen. \'93What are you doing, checking for letter \
bombs?\'94 He chuckled at his own joke. \
\
Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his \
letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the \
postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the \
yellow envelope. \
\
Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, \
and flipped over the postcard. \
\
\'93Marge\'92s ill,\'94 he informed Aunt Petunia. \'93Ate a funny \
whelk ...\'94 \
\
\'93Dad!\'94 said Dudley suddenly. \'93Dad, Harry\'92s got \
something!\'94 \
\
Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which \
was written on the same heavy parchment as the \
envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand \
by Uncle Vernon. \
\
\'93That\'92s mine\\\'94 said Harry, trying to snatch it back. \
\
\'93Who\'92d be writing to you?\'94 sneered Uncle Vernon, \
shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at \
it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of \
traffic lights. And it didn\'92t stop there. Within seconds \
it was the grayish white of old porridge. \
\
\'93P-P-Petunia!\'94 he gasped. \
\
\
\
Page | 38 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle \
Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia \
took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment \
it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her \
throat and made a choking noise. \
\
\'93Vernon! Oh my goodness \'97 Vernon!\'94 \
\
They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten \
that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley \
wasn\'92t used to being ignored. He gave his father a \
sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick. \
\
\'93I want to read that letter,\'94 he said loudly. \
\
\'93I want to read it,\'94 said Harry furiously, \'93as it\'92s mine.\'94 \
\
\'93Get out, both of you,\'94 croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing \
the letter back inside its envelope. \
\
Harry didn\'92t move. \
\
\'93I WANT MY LETTER!\'94 he shouted. \
\
\'93Let me see it!\'94 demanded Dudley. \
\
\'93OUT!\'94 roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry \
and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw \
them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind \
them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but \
silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; \
Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one \
ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack \
between door and floor. \
\
\'93Vernon,\'94 Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering \
voice, \'93look at the address \'97 how could they possibly \
know where he sleeps? You don\'92t think they\'92re \
watching the house?\'94 \
\
Page | 39 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Watching \'97 spying \'97 might be following us,\'94 \
muttered Uncle Vernon wildly. \
\
\'93But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write \
back? Tell them we don\'92t want \'97 \'94 \
\
Harry could see Uncle Vernon\'92s shiny black shoes \
pacing up and down the kitchen. \
\
\'93No,\'94 he said finally. \'93No, we\'92ll ignore it. If they don\'92t \
get an answer. ... Yes, that\'92s best ... we won\'92t do \
anything. ...\'94 \
\
\'93But \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93I\'92m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn\'92t we \
swear when we took him in we\'92d stamp out that \
dangerous nonsense?\'94 \
\
That evening when he got back from work, Uncle \
Vernon did something he\'92d never done before; he \
visited Harry in his cupboard. \
\
\'93Where\'92s my letter?\'94 said Harry, the moment Uncle \
Vernon had squeezed through the door. \'93Who\'92s \
writing to me?\'94 \
\
\'93No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,\'94 said \
Uncle Vernon shortly. \'93I have burned it.\'94 \
\
\'93It was not a mistake,\'94 said Harry angrily, \'93it had my \
cupboard on it.\'94 \
\
\'93SILENCE!\'94 yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of \
spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep \
breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which \
looked quite painful. \
\
\
\
Page | 40 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Er \'97 yes, Harry \'97 about this cupboard. Your aunt \
and I have been thinking ... you\'92re really getting a bit \
big for it . . . we think it might be nice if you moved \
into Dudley\'92s second bedroom.\'94 \
\
\'93Why?\'94 said Harry. \
\
\'93Don\'92t ask questions!\'94 snapped his uncle. \'93Take this \
stuff upstairs, now.\'94 \
\
The Dursleys\'92 house had four bedrooms: one for \
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors \
(usually Uncle Vernon\'92s sister, Marge), one where \
Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys \
and things that wouldn\'92t fit into his first bedroom. It \
only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything \
he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat \
down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly \
everything in here was broken. The month-old video \
camera was lying on top of a small, working tank \
Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor\'92s \
dog; in the corner was Dudley\'92s first-ever television \
set, which he\'92d put his foot through when his favorite \
program had been canceled; there was a large \
birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley \
had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was \
up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley \
had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They \
were the only things in the room that looked as \
though they\'92d never been touched. \
\
From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling \
at his mother, \'93I don\'92t want him in there ... I need \
that room ... make him get out. ...\'94 \
\
Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday \
he\'92d have given anything to be up here. Today he\'92d \
rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than \
up here without it. \
\
Page | 41 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. \
Dudley was in shock. He\'92d screamed, whacked his \
father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, \
kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through \
the greenhouse roof, and he still didn\'92t have his room \
back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday \
and bitterly wishing he\'92d opened the letter in the hall. \
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each \
other darkly. \
\
When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to \
be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get \
it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting \
stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \
\'93There\'92s another one! \'91Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest \
Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive \'97 \'92 \'94 \
\
With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his \
seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. \
Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to \
get the letter from him, which was made difficult by \
the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around \
the neck from behind. After a minute of confused \
fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the \
Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, \
gasping for breath, with Harry\'92s letter clutched in his \
hand. \
\
\'93Go to your cupboard \'97 I mean, your bedroom,\'94 he \
wheezed at Harry. \'93Dudley \'97 go \'97 just go.\'94 \
\
Harry walked round and round his new room. \
Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and \
they seemed to know he hadn\'92t received his first \
letter. Surely that meant they\'92d try again? And this \
time he\'92d make sure they didn\'92t fail. He had a plan. \
\
The repaired alarm clock rang at six o\'92clock the next \
morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed \
\
Page | 42 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
silently. He mustn\'92t wake the Dursleys. He stole \
downstairs without turning on any of the lights. \
\
He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of \
Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. \
His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall \
toward the front door \'97 \
\
\'93AAAAARRRGH ! \'94 \
\
Harry leapt into the air; he\'92d trodden on something \
big and squashy on the doormat \'97 something alive\\ \
\
Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry \
realized that the big, squashy something had been his \
uncle\'92s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot \
of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making \
sure that Harry didn\'92t do exactly what he\'92d been \
trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an \
hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. \
Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by \
the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into \
Uncle Vernon\'92s lap. Harry could see three letters \
addressed in green ink. \
\
\'93I want \'97 \'94 he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing \
the letters into pieces before his eyes. \
\
Uncle Vernon didn\'92t go to work that day. He stayed at \
home and nailed up the mail slot. \
\
\'93See,\'94 he explained to Aunt Petunia through a \
mouthful of nails, \'93if they can\'92t deliver them they\'92ll \
just give up.\'94 \
\
\'93I\'92m not sure that\'92ll work, Vernon.\'94 \
\
\'93Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, \
Petunia, they\'92re not like you and me,\'94 said Uncle \
\
Page | 43 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of \
fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him. \
\
On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for \
Harry. As they couldn\'92t go through the mail slot they \
had been pushed under the door, slotted through the \
sides, and a few even forced through the small \
window in the downstairs bathroom. \
\
Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all \
the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and \
boarded up the cracks around the front and back \
doors so no one could go out. He hummed \'93Tiptoe \
Through the Tulips\'94 as he worked, and jumped at \
small noises. \
\
On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. \
Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the \
house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two \
dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had \
handed Aunt Petunia through the living room \
window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone \
calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find \
someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the \
letters in her food processor. \
\
\'93Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\'94 \
Dudley asked Harry in amazement. \
\
\
\
\'95k k k \
\
\
\
On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the \
breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. \
\
\'93No post on Sundays,\'94 he reminded them cheerfully \
as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, \'93no \
damn letters today \'97 \'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 44 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney \
as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of \
the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came \
pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys \
ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch \
one \'97 \
\
\'93Out! OUT!\'94 \
\
Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and \
threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and \
Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, \
Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could \
hear the letters still streaming into the room, \
bouncing off the walls and floor. \
\
\'93That does it,\'94 said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak \
calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at \
the same time. \'93I want you all back here in five \
minutes ready to leave. We\'92re going away. Just pack \
some clothes. No arguments!\'94 \
\
He looked so dangerous with half his mustache \
missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later \
they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up \
doors and were in the car, speeding toward the \
highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his \
father had hit him round the head for holding them \
up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and \
computer in his sports bag. \
\
They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn\'92t \
dare ask where they were going. Every now and then \
Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in \
the opposite direction for a while. \
\
\'93Shake \'92em off ... shake \'92em off,\'94 he would mutter \
whenever he did this. \
\
\
\
Page | 45 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
They didn\'92t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall \
Dudley was howling. He\'92d never had such a bad day \
in his life. He was hungry, he\'92d missed five television \
programs he\'92d wanted to see, and he\'92d never gone so \
long without blowing up an alien on his computer. \
\
Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy- \
looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley \
and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, \
musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, \
sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of \
passing cars and wondering... \
\
They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on \
toast for breakfast the next day. They had just \
finished when the owner of the hotel came over to \
their table. \
\
\'93 \'92Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I \
got about an \'92undred of these at the front desk.\'94 \
\
She held up a letter so they could read the green ink \
address: \
\
Mr. H. Potter \
\
Room 1 7 \
\
Railview Hotel \
\
Cokeworth \
\
Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon \
knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared. \
\
\'93I\'92ll take them,\'94 said Uncle Vernon, standing up \
quickly and following her from the dining room. \
\
\'95k k k \
\
Page | 46 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Wouldn\'92t it be better just to go home, dear?\'94 Aunt \
Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle \
Vernon didn\'92t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was \
looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into \
the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook \
his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. \
The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed \
field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the \
top of a multilevel parking garage. \
\
\'93Daddy\'92s gone mad, hasn\'92t he?\'94 Dudley asked Aunt \
Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had \
parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, \
and disappeared. \
\
It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the \
car. Dudley sniveled. \
\
\'93It\'92s Monday,\'94 he told his mother. \'93The Great \
Humberto\'92s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with \
a television.\'94 \
\
Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was \
Monday \'97 and you could usually count on Dudley to \
know the days of the week, because of television \'97 \
then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry\'92s eleventh \
birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly \
fun \'97 last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat \
hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon\'92s old socks. Still, \
you weren\'92t eleven every day. \
\
Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was \
also carrying a long, thin package and didn\'92t answer \
Aunt Petunia when she asked what he\'92d bought. \
\
\'93Found the perfect place!\'94 he said. \'93Come on! \
\
Everyone out!\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 47 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was \
pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at \
sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most \
miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing \
was certain, there was no television in there. \
\
\'93Storm forecast for tonight!\'94 said Uncle Vernon \
gleefully, clapping his hands together. \'93And this \
gentleman\'92s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!\'94 \
\
A toothless old man came ambling up to them, \
pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat \
bobbing in the iron-gray water below them. \
\
\'93I\'92ve already got us some rations,\'94 said Uncle Vernon, \
\'93so all aboard!\'94 \
\
It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain \
crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped \
their faces. After what seemed like hours they \
reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and \
sliding, led the way to the broken-down house. \
\
The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of \
seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the \
wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. \
There were only two rooms. \
\
Uncle Vernon\'92s rations turned out to be a bag of chips \
each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the \
empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up. \
\
\'93Could do with some of those letters now, eh?\'94 he said \
cheerfully. \
\
He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought \
nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a \
storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though \
the thought didn\'92t cheer him up at all. \
\

\
\
\
\
As night fell, the promised storm blew up around \
them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls \
of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy \
windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in \
the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on \
the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off \
to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find \
the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under \
the thinnest, most ragged blanket. \
\
The storm raged more and more ferociously as the \
night went on. Harry couldn\'92t sleep. He shivered and \
turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach \
rumbling with hunger. Dudley\'92s snores were drowned \
by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. \
The lighted dial of Dudley\'92s watch, which was \
dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told \
Harry he\'92d be eleven in ten minutes\'92 time. He lay and \
watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the \
Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the \
letter writer was now. \
\
Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak \
outside. He hoped the roof wasn\'92t going to fall in, \
although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes \
to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so \
full of letters when they got back that he\'92d be able to \
steal one somehow. \
\
Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard \
on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what \
was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock \
crumbling into the sea? \
\
One minute to go and he\'92d be eleven. Thirty seconds \
... twenty ... ten ... nine \'97 maybe he\'92d wake Dudley \
up, just to annoy him \'97 three ... two ... one ... \
\
BOOM. \
\
Page | 49 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, \
staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking \
to come in. \
\
\
\
Page | 50 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\
\
THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS \
\
BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. \
\
\'93Where\'92s the cannon?\'94 he said stupidly. \
\
There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon \
came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in \
his hands \'97 now they knew what had been in the \
long, thin package he had brought with them. \
\
\'93Who\'92s there?\'94 he shouted. \'93I warn you \'97 I\'92m armed!\'94 \
\
There was a pause. Then \'97 \
\
SMASH! \
\
The door was hit with such force that it swung clean \
off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat \
on the floor. \
\
A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His \
face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy \
mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could \
\
Page | 51 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under \
all the hair. \
\
The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so \
that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, \
picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its \
frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. \
He turned to look at them all. \
\
\'93Couldn\'92t make us a cup o\'92 tea, could yeh? It\'92s not \
been an easy journey. ...\'94 \
\
He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen \
with fear. \
\
\'93Budge up, yeh great lump,\'94 said the stranger. \
\
Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, \
who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon. \
\
\'93An\'92 here\'92s Harry!\'94 said the giant. \
\
Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face \
and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. \
\
\'93Las\'92 time I saw you, you was only a baby,\'94 said the \
giant. \'93Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh\'92ve got yer \
mom\'92s eyes.\'94 \
\
Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise. \
\
\'93I demand that you leave at once, sir!\'94 he said. \'93You \
are breaking and entering!\'94 \
\
\'93Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\'94 said the \
giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the \
gun out of Uncle Vernon\'92s hands, bent it into a knot \
as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw \
it into a corner of the room. \
\
Page | 52 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a \
mouse being trodden on. \
\
\'93Anyway \'97 Harry,\'94 said the giant, turning his back \
on the Dursleys, \'93a very happy birthday to yeh. Got \
summat fer yeh here \'97 I mighta sat on it at some \
point, but it\'92ll taste all right.\'94 \
\
From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled \
a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with \
trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate \
cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green \
icing. \
\
Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank \
you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, \
and what he said instead was, \'93Who are you?\'94 \
\
The giant chuckled. \
\
\'93True, I haven\'92t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, \
Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.\'94 \
\
He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry\'92s \
whole arm. \
\
\'93What about that tea then, eh?\'94 he said, rubbing his \
hands together. \'93I\'92d not say no ter summat stronger if \
yeh\'92ve got it, mind.\'94 \
\
His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled \
chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the \
fireplace; they couldn\'92t see what he was doing but \
when he drew back a second later, there was a \
roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with \
flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over \
him as though he\'92d sunk into a hot bath. \
\
\
\
Page | 53 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged \
under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things \
out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a \
squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, \
several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber \
liquid that he took a swig from before starting to \
make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and \
smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while \
the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, \
juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley \
fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, \'93Don\'92t \
touch anything he gives you, Dudley.\'94 \
\
The giant chuckled darkly. \
\
\'93Yer great puddin\'92 of a son don\'92 need fattenin\'92 \
anymore, Dursley, don\'92 worry.\'94 \
\
He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry \
he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he \
still couldn\'92t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as \
nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, \
\'93I\'92m sorry, but I still don\'92t really know who you are.\'94 \
\
The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with \
the back of his hand. \
\
\'93Call me Hagrid,\'94 he said, \'93everyone does. An\'92 like I \
told yeh, I\'92m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts \'97 yeh\'92ll \
know all about Hogwarts, o\'92 course.\'94 \
\
\'93Er \'97 no,\'94 said Harry. \
\
Hagrid looked shocked. \
\
\'93Sorry,\'94 Harry said quickly. \
\
\'93Sorry?\'94 barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the \
Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. \'93It\'92s \
\
Page | 54 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren\'92t gettin\'92 \
yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn\'92t even \
know abou\'92 Hogwarts, fer cryin\'92 out loud! Did yeh \
never wonder where yer parents learned it all?\'94 \
\
\'93All what?\'94 asked Harry. \
\
\'93ALL WHAT?\'94 Hagrid thundered. \'93Now wait jus\'92 one \
second!\'94 \
\
He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill \
the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against \
the wall. \
\
\'93Do you mean ter tell me,\'94 he growled at the Dursleys, \
\'93that this boy \'97 this boy! \'97 knows nothin\'92 abou\'92 \'97 \
about ANYTHING?\'94 \
\
Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to \
school, after all, and his marks weren\'92t bad. \
\
\'93I know some things,\'94 he said. \'93I can, you know, do \
math and stuff.\'94 \
\
But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, \'93About \
our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents\'92 \
world.\'94 \
\
\'93What world?\'94 \
\
Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode. \
\'93DURSLEY!\'94 he boomed. \
\
Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered \
something that sounded like \'93Mimblewimble.\'94 Hagrid \
stared wildly at Harry. \
\
\
\
Page | 55 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,\'94 he \
said. \'93I mean, they\'92re famous. You\'92re famous.\'94 \
\
\'93What? My \'97 my mom and dad weren\'92t famous, were \
they?\'94 \
\
\'93Yeh don\'92 know ... yeh don\'92 know ...\'94 Hagrid ran his \
fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a \
bewildered stare. \
\
\'93Yeh don\'92 know what yeh are?\'94 he said finally. \
\
Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice. \
\
\'93Stop!\'94 he commanded. \'93Stop right there, sir! I forbid \
you to tell the boy anything!\'94 \
\
A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have \
quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; \
when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with \
rage. \
\
\'93You never told him? Never told him what was in the \
letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw \
Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An\'92 you\'92ve kept it from \
him all these years?\'94 \
\
\'93Kept what from me?\'94 said Harry eagerly. \
\
\'93STOP! I FORBID YOU!\'94 yelled Uncle Vernon in panic. \
\
Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror. \
\
\'93Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,\'94 said Hagrid. \
\'93Harry \'97 yer a wizard.\'94 \
\
There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and \
the whistling wind could be heard. \
\
\
\
Page | 56 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93I\'92m a what?\'94 gasped Harry. \
\
\
\
\'93A wizard, o\'92 course,\'94 said Hagrid, sitting back down \
on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, \'93an\'92 \
a thumpin\'92 good\'92un, I\'92d say, once yeh\'92ve been trained \
up a bit. With a mum an\'92 dad like yours, what else \
would yeh be? An\'92 I reckon it\'92s abou\'92 time yeh read \
yer letter.\'94 \
\
Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the \
yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. \
H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He \
pulled out the letter and read: \
\
HOGWARTS SCHOOL \
o/WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY \
\
Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE \
\
(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sore., Chf. \
\
Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of \
Wizards) \
\
Dear Mr. Potter, \
\
We are pleased to inform you that you have been \
accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and \
Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary \
books and equipment. \
\
Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no \
later than July 31. \
\
Yours sincerely, \
\
Minerva McGonagall, \
\
Deputy Headmistress \
\
\
\
Page | 57 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Questions exploded inside Harry\'92s head like fireworks \
and he couldn\'92t decide which to ask first. After a few \
minutes he stammered, \'93What does it mean, they \
await my owl?\'94 \
\
\'93Gallopin\'92 Gorgons, that reminds me,\'94 said Hagrid, \
clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to \
knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket \
inside his overcoat he pulled an owl \'97 a real, live, \
rather ruffled-looking owl \'97 a long quill, and a roll of \
parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he \
scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: \
\
Dear Professor Dumbledore, \
\
Given Harry his letter. \
\
Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. \
\
Weather\'92s horrible. Hope you\'92re well. \
\
Hagrid \
\
Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which \
clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw \
the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and \
sat down as though this was as normal as talking on \
the telephone. \
\
Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it \
quickly. \
\
\'93Where was I?\'94 said Hagrid, but at that moment, \
\
Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very \
angry, moved into the firelight. \
\
\'93He\'92s not going,\'94 he said. \
\
Hagrid grunted. \
\
Page | 58 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93I\'92d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,\'94 he \
said. \
\
\
\
\'93A what?\'94 said Harry, interested. \
\
\'93A Muggle,\'94 said Hagrid, \'93it\'92s what we call nonmagic \
folk like them. An\'92 it\'92s your bad luck you grew up in a \
family o\'92 the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.\'94 \
\
\'93We swore when we took him in we\'92d put a stop to \
that rubbish,\'94 said Uncle Vernon, \'93swore we\'92d stamp \
it out of him! Wizard indeed!\'94 \
\
\'93You knew?\'94 said Harry. \'93You knew I\'92m a \'97 a \
wizard?\'94 \
\
\'93Knew!\'94 shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. \'93Knew\\ Of \
course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted \
sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just \
like that and disappeared off to that \'97 that school \'97 \
and came home every vacation with her pockets full \
of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the \
only one who saw her for what she was \'97 a freak! \
\
But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this \
and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in \
the family!\'94 \
\
She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went \
ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all \
this for years. \
\
\'93Then she met that Potter at school and they left and \
got married and had you, and of course I knew you\'92d \
be just the same, just as strange, just as \'97 as \'97 \
abnormal \'97 and then, if you please, she went and got \
herself blown up and we got landed with you!\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 59 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his \
voice he said, \'93Blown up? You told me they died in a \
car crash!\'94 \
\
\'93CAR CRASH!\'94 roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily \
that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. \'93How \
could a car crash kill Lily an\'92 James Potter? It\'92s an \
outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin\'92 his own \
story when every kid in our world knows his name!\'94 \
\
\'93But why? What happened?\'94 Harry asked urgently. \
\
The anger faded from Hagrid\'92s face. He looked \
suddenly anxious. \
\
\'93I never expected this,\'94 he said, in a low, worried \
voice. \'93I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there \
might be trouble gettin\'92 hold of yeh, how much yeh \
didn\'92t know. Ah, Harry, I don\'92 know if I\'92m the right \
person ter tell yeh \'97 but someone\'92s gotta \'97 yeh can\'92t \
go off ter Hogwarts not knowin\'92.\'94 \
\
He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys. \
\
\'93Well, it\'92s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh \'97 \
mind, I can\'92t tell yeh everythin\'92, it\'92s a great myst\'92ry, \
parts of it. ...\'94 \
\
He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, \
and then said, \'93It begins, I suppose, with \'97 with a \
person called \'97 but it\'92s incredible yeh don\'92t know his \
name, everyone in our world knows \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Who?\'94 \
\
\'93Well \'97 I don\'92 like sayin\'92 the name if I can help it. No \
one does.\'94 \
\
\'93Why not?\'94 \
\
Page | 60 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Gulpin\'92 gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. \
Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard \
who went ... bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. \
Worse than worse. His name was ...\'94 \
\
Hagrid gulped, but no words came out. \
\
\'93Could you write it down?\'94 Harry suggested. \
\
\'93Nah \'97 can\'92t spell it. All right \'97 Voldemort.\'94 Hagrid \
shuddered. \'93Don\'92 make me say it again. Anyway, this \
\'97 this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started \
lookin\'92 fer followers. Got \'92em, too \'97 some were afraid, \
some just wanted a bit o\'92 his power, \'92cause he was \
gettin\'92 himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. \
Didn\'92t know who ter trust, didn\'92t dare get friendly \
with strange wizards or witches . . . terrible things \
happened. He was takin\'92 over. \'92Course, some stood up \
to him \'97 an\'92 he killed \'92em. Horribly. One o\'92 the only \
safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore\'92s \
the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn\'92t dare \
try takin\'92 the school, not jus\'92 then, anyway. \
\
\'93Now, yer mum an\'92 dad were as good a witch an\'92 \
wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an\'92 girl at Hogwarts \
in their day! Suppose the myst\'92ry is why You-Know- \
Who never tried to get \'92em on his side before . . . \
probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter \
want anythin\'92 ter do with the Dark Side. \
\
\'93Maybe he thought he could persuade \'92em ... maybe \
he just wanted \'92em outta the way. All anyone knows \
is, he turned up in the village where you was all \
living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a \
year old. He came ter yer house an\'92 \'97 an\'92 \'97 \'94 \
\
Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted \
handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a \
foghorn. \
\
Page | 61 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Sorry,\'94 he said. \'93But it\'92s that sad \'97 knew yer mum \
an\'92 dad, an\'92 nicer people yeh couldn\'92t find \'97 anyway \
\
\
\
\'93You-Know-Who killed \'92em. An\'92 then \'97 an\'92 this is the \
real myst\'92ry of the thing \'97 he tried to kill you, too. \
Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or \
maybe he just liked killin\'92 by then. But he couldn\'92t do \
it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer \
forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That\'92s what yeh \
get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh \'97 took \
care of yer mum an\'92 dad an\'92 yer house, even \'97 but it \
didn\'92t work on you, an\'92 that\'92s why yer famous, Harry. \
No one ever lived after he decided ter kill \'92em, no one \
except you, an\'92 he\'92d killed some o\'92 the best witches \
an\'92 wizards of the age \'97 the McKinnons, the Bones, \
the Prewetts \'97 an\'92 you was only a baby, an\'92 you \
lived.\'94 \
\
Something very painful was going on in Harry\'92s mind. \
As Hagrid\'92s story came to a close, he saw again the \
blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had \
ever remembered it before \'97 and he remembered \
something else, for the first time in his life: a high, \
cold, cruel laugh. \
\
Hagrid was watching him sadly. \
\
\'93Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on \
Dumbledore\'92s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot ...\'94 \
\
\'93Load of old tosh,\'94 said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; \
he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. \
Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his \
courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were \
clenched. \
\
\'93Now, you listen here, boy,\'94 he snarled, \'93I accept \
there\'92s something strange about you, probably \
\
Page | 62 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
nothing a good beating wouldn\'92t have cured \'97 and as \
for all this about your parents, well, they were \
weirdos, no denying it, and the world\'92s better off \
without them in my opinion \'97 asked for all they got, \
getting mixed up with these wizarding types \'97 just \
what I expected, always knew they\'92d come to a sticky \
end \'97 \'94 \
\
But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and \
drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. \
Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, \
\'93I\'92m warning you, Dursley \'97 I\'92m warning you \'97 one \
more word ...\'94 \
\
In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella \
by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon\'92s courage failed \
again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell \
silent. \
\
\'93That\'92s better,\'94 said Hagrid, breathing heavily and \
sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged \
right down to the floor. \
\
Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, \
hundreds of them. \
\
\'93But what happened to Vol-, sorry \'97 I mean, You- \
Know-Who?\'94 \
\
\'93Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same \
night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more \
famous. That\'92s the biggest myst\'92ry, see ... he was \
gettin\'92 more an\'92 more powerful \'97 why\'92d he go? \
\
\'93Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno \
if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say \
he\'92s still out there, bidin\'92 his time, like, but I don\'92 \
believe it. People who was on his side came back ter \
\
\
\
Page | 63 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
ours. Some of \'92em came outta kinda trances. Don\'92 \
reckon they could\'92ve done if he was cornin\'92 back. \
\
\'93Most of us reckon he\'92s still out there somewhere but \
lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. \'92Cause \
somethin\'92 about you finished him, Harry. There was \
somethin\'92 goin\'92 on that night he hadn\'92t counted on \'97 \
/ dunno what it was, no one does \'97 but somethin\'92 \
about you stumped him, all right.\'94 \
\
Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect \
blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling \
pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a \
horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he \
possibly be? He\'92d spent his life being clouted by \
Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle \
Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn\'92t they \
been turned into warty toads every time they\'92d tried \
to lock him in his cupboard? If he\'92d once defeated the \
greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had \
always been able to kick him around like a football? \
\
\'93Hagrid,\'94 he said quietly, \'93I think you must have \
made a mistake. I don\'92t think I can be a wizard.\'94 \
\
To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled. \
\
\'93Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when \
you was scared or angry?\'94 \
\
Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think \
about it . . . every odd thing that had ever made his \
aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when \
he, Harry, had been upset or angry ... chased by \
Dudley\'92s gang, he had somehow found himself out of \
their reach . . . dreading going to school with that \
ridiculous haircut, he\'92d managed to make it grow \
back . . . and the very last time Dudley had hit him, \
\

\
\
hadn\'92t he got his revenge, without even realizing he \
was doing it? Hadn\'92t he set a boa constrictor on him? \
\
\
\
Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that \
Hagrid was positively beaming at him. \
\
\'93See?\'94 said Hagrid. \'93Harry Potter, not a wizard \'97 you \
wait, you\'92ll be right famous at Hogwarts.\'94 \
\
But Uncle Vernon wasn\'92t going to give in without a \
fight. \
\
\'93Haven\'92t I told you he\'92s not going?\'94 he hissed. \'93He\'92s \
going to Stonewall High and he\'92ll be grateful for it. I\'92ve \
read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish \'97 \
spell books and wands and \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won\'92t stop \
him,\'94 growled Hagrid. \'93Stop Lily an\'92 James Potter\'92s \
son goin\'92 ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name\'92s been \
down ever since he was born. He\'92s off ter the finest \
school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven \
years there and he won\'92t know himself. He\'92ll be with \
youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an\'92 he\'92ll be \
under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had, \
Albus Dumbled \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD \
FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!\'94 yelled Uncle \
Vernon. \
\
But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his \
umbrella and whirled it over his head, \'93NEVER \'97 \'94 he \
thundered, \'93\'97 INSULT \'97 ALBUS \'97 DUMBLEDORE \
\'97 IN \'97 FRONT \'97 OF \'97 ME!\'94 \
\
He brought the umbrella swishing down through the \
air to point at Dudley \'97 there was a flash of violet \
light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and \
\

\
\
\
\
the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with \
his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in \
pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a \
curly pig\'92s tail poking through a hole in his trousers. \
\
Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and \
Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified \
look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them. \
\
Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his \
beard. \
\
\'93Shouldn\'92ta lost me temper,\'94 he said ruefully, \'93but it \
didn\'92t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, \
but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there \
wasn\'92t much left ter do.\'94 \
\
He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy \
eyebrows. \
\
\'93Be grateful if yeh didn\'92t mention that ter anyone at \
Hogwarts,\'94 he said. \'93I\'92m \'97 er \'97 not supposed ter do \
magic, strictly speakin\'92. I was allowed ter do a bit ter \
follow yeh an\'92 get yer letters to yeh an\'92 stuff \'97 one o\'92 \
the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Why aren\'92t you supposed to do magic?\'94 asked Harry. \
\
\'93Oh, well \'97 I was at Hogwarts meself but I \'97 er \'97 \
got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. \
They snapped me wand in half an\'92 everything. But \
Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great \
man, Dumbledore.\'94 \
\
\'93Why were you expelled?\'94 \
\
\'93It\'92s gettin\'92 late and we\'92ve got lots ter do tomorrow,\'94 \
said Hagrid loudly. \'93Gotta get up ter town, get all yer \
books an\'92 that.\'94 \
\
Page | 66 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry. \
\
\
\
\'93You can kip under that,\'94 he said. \'93Don\'92 mind if it \
wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o\'92 dormice in \
one o\'92 the pockets.\'94 \
\
\
\

\
\
\
\
DIAGON ALLY \
\
Harry woke early the next morning. Although he \
could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight. \
\
\'93It was a dream,\'94 he told himself firmly. \'93I dreamed a \
giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a \
school for wizards. When I open my eyes I\'92ll be at \
home in my cupboard.\'94 \
\
There was suddenly a loud tapping noise. \
\
And there\'92s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry \
thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn\'92t open his \
eyes. It had been such a good dream. \
\
Tap. Tap. Tap. \
\
\'93All right,\'94 Harry mumbled, \'93I\'92m getting up.\'94 \
\
He sat up and Hagrid \'92s heavy coat fell off him. The \
hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid \
himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there \
\
\
\
Page | 68 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a \
newspaper held in its beak. \
\
Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as \
though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He \
went straight to the window and jerked it open. The \
owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of \
Hagrid, who didn\'92t wake up. The owl then fluttered \
onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid \'92s coat. \
\
\'93Don\'92t do that.\'94 \
\
Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it \
snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on \
savaging the coat. \
\
\'93Hagrid!\'94 said Harry loudly. \'93There\'92s an owl \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Pay him,\'94 Hagrid grunted into the sofa. \
\
\'93What?\'94 \
\
\'93He wants payin\'92 fer deliverin\'92 the paper. Look in the \
pockets.\'94 \
\
Hagrid \'92s coat seemed to be made of nothing but \
pockets \'97 bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of \
string, peppermint humbugs, teabags ... finally, Harry \
pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins. \
\
\'93Give him five Knuts,\'94 said Hagrid sleepily. \
\
\'93Knuts?\'94 \
\
\'93The little bronze ones.\'94 \
\
Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl \
held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a \
\
\
\
Page | 69 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off \
through the open window. \
\
Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched. \
\
\'93Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter \
London an\'92 buy all yer stuff fer school.\'94 \
\
Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking \
at them. He had just thought of something that made \
him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had \
got a puncture. \
\
\'93Urn \'97 Hagrid?\'94 \
\
\'93Mm?\'94 said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge \
boots. \
\
\'93I haven\'92t got any money \'97 and you heard Uncle \
Vernon last night ... he won\'92t pay for me to go and \
learn magic.\'94 \
\
\'93Don\'92t worry about that,\'94 said Hagrid, standing up \
and scratching his head. \'93D\'92yeh think yer parents \
didn\'92t leave yeh anything?\'94 \
\
\'93But if their house was destroyed \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93They didn\'92 keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, \
first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards\'92 bank. Have a \
sausage, they\'92re not bad cold \'97 an\'92 I wouldn\'92 say no \
teh a bit o\'92 yer birthday cake, neither.\'94 \
\
\'93Wizards have banks?\'94 \
\
\'93Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.\'94 \
\
Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding. \
\
\
\
Page | 70 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Goblins?\'94 \
\
\
\
\'93Yeah \'97 so yeh\'92d be mad ter try an\'92 rob it, I\'92ll tell yeh \
that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the \
safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter \
keep safe \'97 \'92cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o\'92 \
fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore. \
Hogwarts business.\'94 Hagrid drew himself up proudly. \
\'93He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. \
Fetchin\'92 you \'97 gettin\'92 things from Gringotts \'97 knows \
he can trust me, see. \
\
\'93Got everythin\'92? Come on, then.\'94 \
\
Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was \
quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. \
The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with \
a lot of water in the bottom after the storm. \
\
\'93How did you get here?\'94 Harry asked, looking around \
for another boat. \
\
\'93Flew,\'94 said Hagrid. \
\
\'93Flew?\'94 \
\
\'93Yeah \'97 but we\'92ll go back in this. Not s\'92pposed ter \
use magic now I\'92ve got yeh.\'94 \
\
They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at \
Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying. \
\
\'93Seems a shame ter row, though,\'94 said Hagrid, giving \
Harry another of his sideways looks. \'93If I was ter \'97 er \
\'97 speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not \
mentionin\'92 it at Hogwarts?\'94 \
\
\'93Of course not,\'94 said Harry, eager to see more magic. \
Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it \
\
Page | 71 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward \
land. \
\
\'93Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?\'94 \
Harry asked. \
\
\'93Spells \'97 enchantments,\'94 said Hagrid, unfolding his \
newspaper as he spoke. \'93They say there\'92s dragons \
guardin\'92 the high-security vaults. And then yeh gotta \
find yer way \'97 Gringotts is hundreds of miles under \
London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh\'92d die \
of hunger tryin\'92 ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter \
get yer hands on summat.\'94 \
\
Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read \
his newspaper, the Daily Prophet Harry had learned \
from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone \
while they did this, but it was very difficult, he\'92d \
never had so many questions in his life. \
\
\'93Ministry o\'92 Magic messin\'92 things up as usual,\'94 Hagrid \
muttered, turning the page. \
\
\'93There\'92s a Ministry of Magic?\'94 Harry asked, before he \
could stop himself. \
\
\'93 \'92Course,\'94 said Hagrid. \'93They wanted Dumbledore fer \
Minister, o\'92 course, but he\'92d never leave Hogwarts, so \
old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there \
was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every \
morning, askin\'92 fer advice.\'94 \
\
\'93But what does a Ministry of Magic do?\'94 \
\
\'93Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles \
that there\'92s still witches an\'92 wizards up an\'92 down the \
country.\'94 \
\
\'93Why?\'94 \
\
Page | 72 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone \'92d be wantin\'92 magic \
solutions to their problems. Nah, we\'92re best left \
alone.\'94 \
\
At this moment the boat bumped gently into the \
harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and \
they clambered up the stone steps onto the street. \
\
Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked \
through the little town to the station. Harry couldn\'92t \
blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as \
anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary \
things like parking meters and saying loudly, \'93See \
that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?\'94 \
\
\'93Hagrid,\'94 said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep \
up, \'93did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?\'94 \
\
\'93Well, so they say,\'94 said Hagrid. \'93Crikey, I\'92d like a \
dragon.\'94 \
\
\'93You\'92d like one?\'94 \
\
\'93Wanted one ever since I was a kid \'97 here we go.\'94 \
\
They had reached the station. There was a train to \
London in five minutes\'92 time. Hagrid, who didn\'92t \
understand \'93Muggle money,\'94 as he called it, gave the \
bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets. \
\
People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid \
took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a \
canary-yellow circus tent. \
\
\'93Still got yer letter, Harry?\'94 he asked as he counted \
stitches. \
\
Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket. \
\
\
\
Page | 73 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Good,\'94 said Hagrid. \'93There\'92s a list there of everything \
yeh need.\'94 \
\
\
\
Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn\'92t \
noticed the night before, and read: \

\
\'93Can we buy all this in London?\'94 Harry wondered \
aloud. \
\
\'93If yeh know where to go,\'94 said Hagrid. \
\
Harry had never been to London before. Although \
Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was \
obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary \
way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the \
Underground, and complained loudly that the seats \
were too small and the trains too slow. \
\
Page | 75 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93I don\'92t know how the Muggles manage without \
magic,\'94 he said as they climbed a broken-down \
escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with \
shops. \
\
Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; \
all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They \
passed book shops and music stores, hamburger \
restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as \
if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an \
ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there \
really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath \
them? Were there really shops that sold spell books \
and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge \
joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn\'92t \
known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he \
might have thought so; yet somehow, even though \
everything Hagrid had told him so far was \
unbelievable, Harry couldn\'92t help trusting him. \
\
\'93This is it,\'94 said Hagrid, coming to a halt, \'93the Leaky \
Cauldron. It\'92s a famous place.\'94 \
\
It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn\'92t \
pointed it out, Harry wouldn\'92t have noticed it was \
there. The people hurrying by didn\'92t glance at it. Their \
eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the \
record shop on the other as if they couldn\'92t see the \
Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most \
peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. \
Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him \
inside. \
\
For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A \
few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny \
glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long \
pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old \
bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a \
toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped \
Page | 76 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know \
Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the \
bartender reached for a glass, saying, \'93The usual, \
Hagrid?\'94 \
\
\'93Can\'92t, Tom, I\'92m on Hogwarts business,\'94 said Hagrid, \
clapping his great hand on Harry\'92s shoulder and \
making Harry\'92s knees buckle. \
\
\'93Good Lord,\'94 said the bartender, peering at Harry, \'93is \
this \'97 can this be \'97 ?\'94 \
\
The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely \
still and silent. \
\
\'93Bless my soul,\'94 whispered the old bartender, \'93Harry \
Potter ... what an honor.\'94 \
\
He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward \
Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes. \
\
\'93Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\'94 \
\
Harry didn\'92t know what to say. Everyone was looking \
at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it \
without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was \
beaming. \
\
Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the \
next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands \
with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron. \
\
\'93Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can\'92t believe I\'92m meeting \
you at last.\'94 \
\
\'93So proud, Mr. Potter, I\'92m just so proud.\'94 \
\
\'93Always wanted to shake your hand \'97 I\'92m all of a \
flutter.\'94 \
\
Page | 77 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can\'92t tell you, Diggle\'92s the \
name, Dedalus Diggle.\'94 \
\
\'93I\'92ve seen you before!\'94 said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle\'92s \
top hat fell off in his excitement. \'93You bowed to me \
once in a shop.\'94 \
\
\'93He remembers!\'94 cried Dedalus Diggle, looking \
around at everyone. \'93Did you hear that? He \
remembers me!\'94 \
\
Harry shook hands again and again \'97 Doris \
Crockford kept coming back for more. \
\
A pale young man made his way forward, very \
nervously. One of his eyes was twitching. \
\
\'93Professor Quirrell!\'94 said Hagrid. \'93Harry, Professor \
Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.\'94 \
\
\'93P-P-Potter,\'94 stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping \
Harry\'92s hand, \'93c-can\'92t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to \
meet you.\'94 \
\
\'93What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?\'94 \
\
\'93D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\'94 muttered \
Professor Quirrell, as though he\'92d rather not think \
about it. \'93N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?\'94 \
\
He laughed nervously. \'93You\'92ll be g-getting all your \
equipment, I suppose? I\'92ve g-got to p-pick up a new b- \
book on vampires, m-myself.\'94 He looked terrified at \
the very thought. \
\
But the others wouldn\'92t let Professor Quirrell keep \
Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get \
away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make \
himself heard over the babble. \
\
\
\
Page | 78 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Must get on \'97 lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.\'94 \
\
Doris Crockford shook Harry\'92s hand one last time, \
and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a \
small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but \
a trash can and a few weeds. \
\
Hagrid grinned at Harry. \
\
\'93Told yeh, didn\'92t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even \
Professor Quirrell was tremblin\'92 ter meet yeh \'97 mind \
you, he\'92s usually tremblin\'92.\'94 \
\
\'93Is he always that nervous?\'94 \
\
\'93Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine \
while he was studyin\'92 outta books but then he took a \
year off ter get some firsthand experience. ... They say \
he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a \
nasty bit o\'92 trouble with a hag \'97 never been the same \
since. Scared of the students, scared of his own \
subject \'97 now, where\'92s me umbrella?\'94 \
\
Vampires? Hags? Harry\'92s head was swimming. \
\
Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall \
above the trash can. \
\
\'93Three up ... two across ...\'94 he muttered. \'93Right, \
stand back, Harry.\'94 \
\
He tapped the wall three times with the point of his \
umbrella. \
\
The brick he had touched quivered \'97 it wriggled \'97 in \
the middle, a small hole appeared \'97 it grew wider \
and wider \'97 a second later they were facing an \
archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway \
onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of \
sight. \
\
Page | 79 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Welcome,\'94 said Hagrid, \'93to Diagon Alley.\'94 \
\
He grinned at Harry\'92s amazement. They stepped \
through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his \
shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back \
into solid wall. \
\
The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons \
outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons \'97 All Sizes \'97 \
Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver \'97 Self-Stirring \'97 \
Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them. \
\
\'93Yeah, you\'92ll be needin\'92 one,\'94 said Hagrid, \'93but we \
gotta get yer money first.\'94 \
\
Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He \
turned his head in every direction as they walked up \
the street, trying to look at everything at once: the \
shops, the things outside them, the people doing their \
shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary \
was shaking her head as they passed, saying, \
\
\'93Dragon liver, sixteen Sickles an ounce, they\'92re mad.\'94 \
\
A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign \
saying Eeylops Owl Emporium \'97 Tawny, Screech, \
Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about \
Harry\'92s age had their noses pressed against a window \
with broomsticks in it. \'93Look,\'94 Harry heard one of \
them say, \'93the new Nimbus Two Thousand \'97 fastest \
ever \'97 \'94 There were shops selling robes, shops selling \
telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had \
never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of \
bat spleens and eels\'92 eyes, tottering piles of spell \
books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, \
globes of the moon. ... \
\
\'93Gringotts,\'94 said Hagrid. \
\
\
\
Page | 80 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
They had reached a snowy white building that \
towered over the other little shops. Standing beside \
its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of \
scarlet and gold, was \'97 \
\
\'93Yeah, that\'92s a goblin,\'94 said Hagrid quietly as they \
walked up the white stone steps toward him. The \
goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a \
swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry \
noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they \
walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of \
doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon \
them: \
\
Enter, stranger, but take heed \
\
Of what awaits the sin of greed, \
\
For those who take, but do not earn, \
\
Must pay most dearly in their turn. \
\
So if you seek beneath our floors \
\
A treasure that was never yours, \
\
Thief, you have been warned, beware \
\
Of finding more than treasure there. \
\
\'93Like I said, yeh\'92d be mad ter try an\'92 rob it,\'94 said \
Hagrid. \
\
A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors \
and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred \
more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long \
counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in \
brass scales, examining precious stones through \
eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count \

\
\
\
\
leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were \
showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry \
made for the counter. \
\
\'93Morning,\'94 said Hagrid to a free goblin. \'93We\'92ve come \
ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter\'92s safe.\'94 \
\
\'93You have his key, sir?\'94 \
\
\'93Got it here somewhere,\'94 said Hagrid, and he started \
emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a \
handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of \
numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry \
watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of \
rubies as big as glowing coals. \
\
\'93Got it,\'94 said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden \
key. \
\
The goblin looked at it closely. \
\
\'93That seems to be in order.\'94 \
\
\'93An\'92 I\'92ve also got a letter here from Professor \
Dumbledore,\'94 said Hagrid importantly, throwing out \
his chest. \'93It\'92s about the You-Know-What in vault \
seven hundred and thirteen.\'94 \
\
The goblin read the letter carefully. \
\
\'93Very well,\'94 he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \'93I will \
have someone take you down to both vaults. \
Griphook!\'94 \
\
Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had \
crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, \
he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the \
doors leading off the hall. \
\
\
\
Page | 82 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93What\'92s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred \
and thirteen?\'94 Harry asked. \
\
\'93Can\'92t tell yeh that,\'94 said Hagrid mysteriously. \'93Very \
secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore\'92s trusted me. \
More\'92n my job\'92s worth ter tell yeh that.\'94 \
\
Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who \
had expected more marble, was surprised. They were \
in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming \
torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were \
little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled \
and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward \
them. They climbed in \'97 Hagrid with some difficulty \
\'97 and were off. \
\
At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting \
passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, \
left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The \
rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because \
Griphook wasn\'92t steering. \
\
Harry\'92s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, \
but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw \
a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted \
around to see if it was a dragon, but too late \'97 they \
plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake \
where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the \
ceiling and floor. \
\
\'93I never know,\'94 Harry called to Hagrid over the noise \
of the cart, \'93what\'92s the difference between a \
stalagmite and a stalactite?\'94 \
\
\'93Stalagmite\'92s got an \'91m\'92 in it,\'94 said Hagrid. \'93An\'92 don\'92 \
ask me questions just now, I think I\'92m gonna be \
sick.\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 83 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at \
last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid \
got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his \
knees from trembling. \
\
Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke \
came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. \
Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. \
Heaps of little bronze Knuts. \
\
\'93All yours,\'94 smiled Hagrid. \
\
All Harry\'92s \'97 it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn\'92t \
have known about this or they\'92d have had it from him \
faster than blinking. How often had they complained \
how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time \
there had been a small fortune belonging to him, \
buried deep under London. \
\
Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. \
\
\'93The gold ones are Galleons,\'94 he explained. \
\
\'93Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine \
Knuts to a Sickle, it\'92s easy enough. Right, that should \
be enough fer a couple o\'92 terms, we\'92ll keep the rest \
safe for yeh.\'94 He turned to Griphook. \'93Vault seven \
hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go \
more slowly?\'94 \
\
\'93One speed only,\'94 said Griphook. \
\
They were going even deeper now and gathering \
speed. The air became colder and colder as they \
hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over \
an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the \
side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, \
but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff \
of his neck. \
\
\
\
Page | 84 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. \
\
\'93Stand back,\'94 said Griphook importantly. He stroked \
the door gently with one of his long fingers and it \
simply melted away. \
\
\'93If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they\'92d be \
sucked through the door and trapped in there,\'94 said \
Griphook. \
\
\'93How often do you check to see if anyone\'92s inside?\'94 \
Harry asked. \
\
\'93About once every ten years,\'94 said Griphook with a \
rather nasty grin. \
\
Something really extraordinary had to be inside this \
top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned \
forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at \
the very least \'97 but at first he thought it was empty. \
Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up \
in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up \
and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to \
know what it was, but knew better than to ask. \
\
\'93Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don\'92t talk to \
me on the way back, it\'92s best if I keep me mouth \
shut,\'94 said Hagrid. \
\
\
\
One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the \
sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn\'92t know where \
to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He \
didn\'92t have to know how many Galleons there were to \
a pound to know that he was holding more money \
than he\'92d had in his whole life \'97 more money than \
even Dudley had ever had. \
\
\
\
Page | 85 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Might as well get yer uniform,\'94 said Hagrid, nodding \
toward Madam Malkin\'92s Robes for All Occasions. \
\'93Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a \
pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them \
Gringotts carts.\'94 He did still look a bit sick, so Harry \
entered Madam Malkin\'92s shop alone, feeling nervous. \
\
Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all \
in mauve. \
\
\'93Hogwarts, dear?\'94 she said, when Harry started to \
speak. \'93Got the lot here \'97 another young man being \
fitted up just now, in fact.\'94 \
\
In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed \
face was standing on a footstool while a second witch \
pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood \
Harry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over \
his head, and began to pin it to the right length. \
\
\'93Hello,\'94 said the boy, \'93Hogwarts, too?\'94 \
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said Harry. \
\
\'93My father\'92s next door buying my books and mother\'92s \
up the street looking at wands,\'94 said the boy. He had \
a bored, drawling voice. \'93Then I\'92m going to drag them \
off to look at racing brooms. I don\'92t see why first years \
can\'92t have their own. I think I\'92ll bully father into \
getting me one and I\'92ll smuggle it in somehow.\'94 \
\
Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley. \
\
\'93Have you got your own broom?\'94 the boy went on. \
\
\'93No,\'94 said Harry. \
\
\'93Play Quidditch at all?\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 86 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93No,\'94 Harry said again, wondering what on earth \
Quidditch could be. \
\
\'93 I do \'97 Father says it\'92s a crime if I\'92m not picked to \
play for my House, and I must say, I agree. Know \
what House you 11 be in yet?\'94 \
\
\'93No,\'94 said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. \
\
\'93Well, no one really knows until they get there, do \
they, but I know I\'92ll be in Slytherin, all our family \
have been \'97 imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I\'92d \
leave, wouldn\'92t you?\'94 \
\
\'93Mmm,\'94 said Harry, wishing he could say something a \
bit more interesting. \
\
\'93I say, look at that man!\'94 said the boy suddenly, \
nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was \
standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two \
large ice creams to show he couldn\'92t come in. \
\
\'93That\'92s Hagrid,\'94 said Harry, pleased to know \
something the boy didn\'92t. \'93He works at Hogwarts.\'94 \
\
\'93Oh,\'94 said the boy, \'93I\'92ve heard of him. He\'92s a sort of \
servant, isn\'92t he?\'94 \
\
\'93He\'92s the gamekeeper,\'94 said Harry. He was liking the \
boy less and less every second. \
\
\'93Yes, exactly. I heard he\'92s a sort of savage \'97 lives in a \
hut on the school grounds and every now and then he \
gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire \
to his bed.\'94 \
\
\'93I think he\'92s brilliant,\'94 said Harry coldly. \
\
\
\
Page | 87 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Do you?\'94 said the boy, with a slight sneer. \'93Why is he \
with you? Where are your parents?\'94 \
\
\'93They\'92re dead,\'94 said Harry shortly. He didn\'92t feel \
much like going into the matter with this boy. \
\
\'93Oh, sorry,\'94 said the other, not sounding sorry at all. \
\'93But they were our kind, weren\'92t they?\'94 \
\
\'93They were a witch and wizard, if that\'92s what you \
mean.\'94 \
\
\'93I really don\'92t think they should let the other sort in, \
do you? They\'92re just not the same, they\'92ve never been \
brought up to know our ways. Some of them have \
never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, \
imagine. I think they should keep it in the old \
wizarding families. What\'92s your surname, anyway?\'94 \
\
But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \
\'93That\'92s you done, my dear,\'94 and Harry, not sorry for \
an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down \
from the footstool. \
\
\'93Well, I\'92ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\'94 said the \
drawling boy. \
\
Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid \
had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with \
chopped nuts). \
\
\'93What\'92s up?\'94 said Hagrid. \
\
\'93Nothing,\'94 Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment \
and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a \
bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When \
they had left the shop, he said, \'93Hagrid, what\'92s \
Quidditch?\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 88 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin\'92 how little yeh know \'97 \
not knowin\'92 about Quidditch!\'94 \
\
\'93Don\'92t make me feel worse,\'94 said Harry. He told \
Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin\'92s. \
\
\'93 \'97 and he said people from Muggle families shouldn\'92t \
even be allowed in \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Yer not from a Muggle family. If he\'92d known who yeh \
were \'97 he\'92s grown up knowin\'92 yer name if his \
parents are wizardin\'92 folk. You saw what everyone in \
the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. \
Anyway, what does he know about it, some o\'92 the best \
I ever saw were the only ones with magic in \'92em in a \
long line o\'92 Muggles \'97 look at yer mum! Look what \
she had fer a sister!\'94 \
\
\'93So what is Quidditch?\'94 \
\
\'93It\'92s our sport. Wizard sport. It\'92s like \'97 like soccer in \
the Muggle world \'97 everyone follows Quidditch \'97 \
played up in the air on broomsticks and there\'92s four \
balls \'97 sorta hard ter explain the rules.\'94 \
\
\'93And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?\'94 \
\
\'93School Houses. There\'92s four. Everyone says \
Hufflepuff are a lot o\'92 duffers, but \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93I bet I\'92m in Hufflepuff,\'94 said Harry gloomily. \
\
\'93Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\'94 said Hagrid darkly. \
\'93There\'92s not a single witch or wizard who went bad \
who wasn\'92t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.\'94 \
\
\'93Vol-, sorry \'97 You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?\'94 \
\
\'93Years an\'92 years ago,\'94 said Hagrid. \
\
Page | 89 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
They bought Harry\'92s school books in a shop called \
Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to \
the ceiling with books as large as paving stones \
bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in \
covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a \
few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, \
who never read anything, would have been wild to get \
his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to \
drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-curses \
(Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies \
with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, \
Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor \
Vindictus Viridian. \
\
\'93I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.\'94 \
\
\'93I\'92m not sayin\'92 that\'92s not a good idea, but yer not ter \
use magic in the Muggle world except in very special \
circumstances,\'94 said Hagrid. \'93An\'92 anyway, yeh \
couldn\'92 work any of them curses yet, yeh\'92ll need a lot \
more study before yeh get ter that level.\'94 \
\
Hagrid wouldn\'92t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, \
either (\'93It says pewter on yer list\'94), but they got a nice \
set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a \
collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the \
Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make \
up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and \
rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the \
floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders \
lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, \
and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While \
Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a \
supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, \
Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at \
twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery- \
black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). \
\
\
\
Page | 90 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry\'92s list \
again. \
\
\'93Just yer wand left \'97 oh yeah, an\'92 I still haven\'92t got \
yeh a birthday present.\'94 \
\
Harry felt himself go red. \
\
\'93You don\'92t have to \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93I know I don\'92t have to. Tell yeh what, I\'92ll get yer \
animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years \
ago, yeh\'92d be laughed at \'97 an\'92 I don\'92 like cats, they \
make me sneeze. I\'92ll get yer an owl. All the kids want \
owls, they\'92re dead useful, carry yer mail an\'92 \
everythin\'92.\'94 \
\
Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl \
Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling \
and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a \
large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep \
with her head under her wing. He couldn\'92t stop \
stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor \
Quirrell. \
\
\'93Don\'92 mention it,\'94 said Hagrid gruffly. \'93Don\'92 expect \
you\'92ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just \
Ollivanders left now \'97 only place fer wands, \
Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\'94 \
\
A magic wand . . . this was what Harry had been really \
looking forward to. \
\
The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold \
letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine \
Wands since 382b. c. A single wand lay on a faded \
purple cushion in the dusty window. \
\
\
\
Page | 91 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the \
shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, \
empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid \
sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had \
entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new \
questions that had just occurred to him and looked \
instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly \
right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of \
his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here \
seemed to tingle with some secret magic. \
\
\'93Good afternoon,\'94 said a soft voice. Harry jumped. \
Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a \
loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the \
spindly chair. \
\
An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale \
eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the \
shop. \
\
\'93Hello,\'94 said Harry awkwardly. \
\
\'93Ah yes,\'94 said the man. \'93Yes, yes. I thought I\'92d be \
seeing you soon. Harry Potter.\'94 It wasn\'92t a question. \
\'93You have your mother\'92s eyes. It seems only yesterday \
she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten \
and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. \
Nice wand for charm work.\'94 \
\
Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished \
he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. \
\
\'93Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany \
wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and \
excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father \
favored it \'97 it\'92s really the wand that chooses the \
wizard, of course.\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 92 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry \
were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself \
reflected in those misty eyes. \
\
\'93And that\'92s where ...\'94 \
\
Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry\'92s \
forehead with a long, white finger. \
\
\'93I\'92m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\'94 he said \
softly. \'93Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful \
wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands ... well, \
if I\'92d known what that wand was going out into the \
world to do. ...\'94 \
\
He shook his head and then, to Harry\'92s relief, spotted \
Hagrid. \
\
\'93Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again. \
\
... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn\'92t it?\'94 \
\
\'93It was, sir, yes,\'94 said Hagrid. \
\
\'93Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it \
in half when you got expelled?\'94 said Mr. Ollivander, \
suddenly stern. \
\
\'93Er \'97 yes, they did, yes,\'94 said Hagrid, shuffling his \
feet. \'93I\'92ve still got the pieces, though,\'94 he added \
brightly. \
\
\'93But you don\'92t use them?\'94 said Mr. Ollivander \
sharply. \
\
\'93Oh, no, sir,\'94 said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he \
gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. \
\
\'93Hmmm,\'94 said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a \
piercing look. \'93Well, now \'97 Mr. Potter. Let me see.\'94 \
\
Page | 93 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings \
out of his pocket. \'93Which is your wand arm?\'94 \
\
\'93Er \'97 well, I\'92m right-handed,\'94 said Harry. \
\
\'93Hold out your arm. That\'92s it.\'94 He measured Harry \
from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder \
to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he \
measured, he said, \'93Every Ollivander wand has a core \
of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use \
unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the \
heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are \
the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or \
phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will \
never get such good results with another wizard\'92s \
wand.\'94 \
\
Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which \
was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this \
on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the \
shelves, taking down boxes. \
\
\'93That will do,\'94 he said, and the tape measure \
crumpled into a heap on the floor. \'93Right then, Mr. \
Potter. Try this one. Beech-wood and dragon \
heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take \
it and give it a wave.\'94 \
\
Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it \
around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his \
hand almost at once. \
\
\'93Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite \
whippy. Try \'97 \'94 \
\
Harry tried \'97 but he had hardly raised the wand \
when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander. \
\
\
\
Page | 94 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93No, no \'97 here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a \
half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.\'94 \
\
Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. \
Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands \
was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, \
but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the \
shelves, the happier he seemed to become. \
\
\'93Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, well find the \
perfect match here somewhere \'97 I wonder, now \'97 \
yes, why not \'97 unusual combination \'97 holly and \
phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.\'94 \
\
Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his \
fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it \
swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of \
red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, \
throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid \
whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, \'93Oh, \
bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well ... \
how curious ... how very curious ...\'94 \
\
He put Harry\'92s wand back into its box and wrapped it \
in brown paper, still muttering, \'93Curious . . . curious \
\
\
\
\'93Sorry,\'94 said Harry, \'93but what\'92s curious?\'94 \
\
Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare. \
\
\'93I remember every wand I\'92ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. \
Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix \
whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another \
feather \'97 just one other. It is very curious indeed \
that you should be destined for this wand when its \
brother \'97 why, its brother gave you that scar.\'94 \
\
\
\
Harry swallowed. \
\
Page | 95 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed \
how these things happen. The wand chooses the \
wizard, remember. ... I think we must expect great \
things from you, Mr. Potter. ... After all, He-Who- \
Must-Not-Be-Named did great things \'97 terrible, yes, \
but great.\'94 \
\
Harry shivered. He wasn\'92t sure he liked Mr. \
\
Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for \
his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his \
shop. \
\
The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry \
and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, \
back through the wall, back through the Leaky \
Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn\'92t speak at all as \
they walked down the road; he didn\'92t even notice how \
much people were gawking at them on the \
Underground, laden as they were with all their funny- \
shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its \
cage on Harry\'92s lap. Up another escalator, out into \
Paddington station; Harry only realized where they \
were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder. \
\
\'93Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\'94 he \
said. \
\
He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on \
plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. \
Everything looked so strange, somehow. \
\
\'93You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,\'94 said Hagrid. \
\
Harry wasn\'92t sure he could explain. He\'92d just had the \
best birthday of his life \'97 and yet \'97 he chewed his \
hamburger, trying to find the words. \
\
\'93Everyone thinks I\'92m special,\'94 he said at last. \'93All \
those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor \
\

\
\
\
Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander ... but I don\'92t know anything \
about magic at all. How can they expect great things? \
I\'92m famous and I can\'92t even remember what I\'92m \
famous for. I don\'92t know what happened when Vol-, \
sorry \'97 I mean, the night my parents died.\'94 \
\
Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard \
and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile. \
\
\'93Don\'92 you worry, Harry. You\'92ll learn fast enough. \
Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you\'92ll \
be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it\'92s hard. Yeh\'92ve \
been singled out, an\'92 that\'92s always hard. But yeh\'92ll \
have a great time at Hogwarts \'97 I did \'97 still do, \
\'92smatter of fact.\'94 \
\
Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take \
him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an \
envelope. \
\
\'93Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,\'94 he said. \'93First o\'92 September \
\'97 King\'92s Cross \'97 it\'92s all on yer ticket. Any problems \
with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she\'92ll \
know where to find me. ... See yeh soon, Harry.\'94 \
\
The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to \
watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his \
seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he \
blinked and Hagrid had gone. \

THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM \
NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS \
\
Harry\'92s last month with the Dursleys wasn\'92t fun. \
True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn\'92t \
stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle \
Vernon didn\'92t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him \
to do anything, or shout at him \'97 in fact, they didn\'92t \
speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they \
acted as though any chair with Harry in it were \
empty. Although this was an improvement in many \
ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while. \
\
Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for \
company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name \
he had found in A History of Magic. His school books \
were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late \
into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the \
open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt \
Petunia didn\'92t come in to vacuum anymore, because \
Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night \
before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day \
\
\
\
Page | 98 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, \
counting down to September the first. \
\
On the last day of August he thought he\'92d better \
speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King\'92s \
Cross station the next day, so he went down to the \
living room where they were watching a quiz show on \
television. He cleared his throat to let them know he \
was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the \
room. \
\
\'93Er \'97 Uncle Vernon?\'94 \
\
Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening. \
\
\'93Er \'97 I need to be at King\'92s Cross tomorrow to \'97 to \
go to Hogwarts.\'94 \
\
Uncle Vernon grunted again. \
\
\'93Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?\'94 \
\
Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes. \
\
\'93Thank you.\'94 \
\
He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon \
actually spoke. \
\
\'93Funny way to get to a wizards\'92 school, the train. \
Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?\'94 \
\
Harry didn\'92t say anything. \
\
\'93Where is this school, anyway?\'94 \
\
\'93I don\'92t know,\'94 said Harry, realizing this for the first \
time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of \
his pocket. \
\
Page | 99 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93I just take the train from platform nine and three- \
quarters at eleven o\'92clock,\'94 he read. \
\
His aunt and uncle stared. \
\
\'93Platform what?\'94 \
\
\'93Nine and three-quarters.\'94 \
\
\'93Don\'92t talk rubbish,\'94 said Uncle Vernon. \'93There is no \
platform nine and three-quarters.\'94 \
\
\'93It\'92s on my ticket.\'94 \
\
\'93Barking,\'94 said Uncle Vernon, \'93howling mad, the lot of \
them. You 11 see. You just wait. All right, we\'92ll take \
you to King\'92s Cross. We\'92re going up to London \
tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn\'92t bother.\'94 \
\
\'93Why are you going to London?\'94 Harry asked, trying \
to keep things friendly. \
\
\'93Taking Dudley to the hospital,\'94 growled Uncle \
Vernon. \'93Got to have that ruddy tail removed before \
he goes to Smeltings.\'94 \
\
Harry woke at five o\'92clock the next morning and was \
too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up \
and pulled on his jeans because he didn\'92t want to \
walk into the station in his wizard\'92s robes \'97 he\'92d \
change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet \
again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw \
that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then \
paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. \
Two hours later, Harry\'92s huge, heavy trunk had been \
loaded into the Dursleys\'92 car, Aunt Petunia had \
talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had \
set off. \
\
\
\
Page | 100 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
They reached King\'92s Cross at half past ten. Uncle \
Vernon dumped Harry\'92s trunk onto a cart and \
wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this \
was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, \
facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face. \
\
\'93Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine \'97 platform \
ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the \
middle, but they don\'92t seem to have built it yet, do \
they?\'94 \
\
He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic \
number nine over one platform and a big plastic \
number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, \
nothing at all. \
\
\'93Have a good term,\'94 said Uncle Vernon with an even \
nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry \
turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of \
them were laughing. Harry\'92s mouth went rather dry. \
What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to \
attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He\'92d \
have to ask someone. \
\
He stopped a passing guard, but didn\'92t dare mention \
platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had \
never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn\'92t \
even tell him what part of the country it was in, he \
started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being \
stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for \
the train that left at eleven o\'92clock, but the guard said \
there wasn\'92t one. In the end the guard strode away, \
muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying \
hard not to panic. According to the large clock over \
the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on \
the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; \
he was stranded in the middle of a station with a \
trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard \
money, and a large owl. \
\
Page | 101 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you \
had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to \
get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get \
out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector\'92s \
stand between platforms nine and ten. \
\
At that moment a group of people passed just behind \
him and he caught a few words of what they were \
saying. \
\
\'93 \'97 packed with Muggles, of course \'97 \'94 \
\
Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump \
woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming \
red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like \
Harry\'92s in front of him \'97 and they had an owl. \
\
Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. \
They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear \
what they were saying. \
\
\'93Now, what\'92s the platform number?\'94 said the boys\'92 \
mother. \
\
\'93Nine and three-quarters!\'94 piped a small girl, also red- \
headed, who was holding her hand, \'93Mom, can\'92t I go \
\
\
\
\'93You\'92re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, \
Percy, you go first.\'94 \
\
What looked like the oldest boy marched toward \
platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to \
blink in case he missed it \'97 but just as the boy \
reached the dividing barrier between the two \
platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in \
front of him and by the time the last backpack had \
cleared away, the boy had vanished. \
\
\
\
Page | 102 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Fred, you next,\'94 the plump woman said. \
\
\
\
\'93I\'92m not Fred, I\'92m George,\'94 said the boy. \'93Honestly, \
woman, you call yourself our mother? Can\'92t you tell \
I\'92m George?\'94 \
\
\'93Sorry, George, dear.\'94 \
\
\'93Only joking, I am Fred,\'94 said the boy, and off he \
went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he \
must have done so, because a second later, he had \
gone \'97 but how had he done it? \
\
Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the \
barrier \'97 he was almost there \'97 and then, quite \
suddenly, he wasn\'92t anywhere. \
\
There was nothing else for it. \
\
\'93Excuse me,\'94 Harry said to the plump woman. \
\
\'93Hello, dear,\'94 she said. \'93First time at Hogwarts? Ron\'92s \
new, too.\'94 \
\
She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He \
was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands \
and feet, and a long nose. \
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said Harry. \'93The thing is \'97 the thing is, I don\'92t \
know how to \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93How to get onto the platform?\'94 she said kindly, and \
Harry nodded. \
\
\'93Not to worry,\'94 she said. \'93All you have to do is walk \
straight at the barrier between platforms nine and \
ten. Don\'92t stop and don\'92t be scared you\'92ll crash into \
it, that\'92s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if \
you\'92re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.\'94 \
\
Page | 103 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Er \'97 okay,\'94 said Harry. \
\
He pushed his trolley around and stared at the \
barrier. It looked very solid. \
\
He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on \
their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked \
more quickly. He was going to smash right into that \
barrier and then he\'92d be in trouble \'97 leaning forward \
on his cart, he broke into a heavy run \'97 the barrier \
was coming nearer and nearer \'97 he wouldn\'92t be able \
to stop \'97 the cart was out of control \'97 he was a foot \
away \'97 he closed his eyes ready for the crash \'97 \
\
It didn\'92t come ... he kept on running ... he opened his \
eyes. \
\
A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform \
packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts \
Express, eleven o\'92clock. Harry looked behind him and \
saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had \
been, with the words Platform Nine and Three- \
Quarters on it. He had done it. \
\
Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the \
chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound \
here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one \
another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble \
and the scraping of heavy trunks. \
\
The first few carriages were already packed with \
students, some hanging out of the window to talk to \
their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed \
his cart off down the platform in search of an empty \
seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, \
\'93Gran, I\'92ve lost my toad again.\'94 \
\
\'93Oh, Neville,\'94 he heard the old woman sigh. \
\
\
\
Page | 104 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small \
crowd. \
\
\
\
\'93Give us a look, Lee, go on.\'94 \
\
The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the \
people around him shrieked and yelled as something \
inside poked out a long, hairy leg. \
\
Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found \
an empty compartment near the end of the train. He \
put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and \
heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift \
it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and \
twice he dropped it painfully on his foot. \
\
\'93Want a hand?\'94 It was one of the red-haired twins \
he\'92d followed through the barrier. \
\
\'93Yes, please,\'94 Harry panted. \
\
\'93Oy, Fred! C\'92mere and help!\'94 \
\
With the twins\'92 help, Harry\'92s trunk was at last tucked \
away in a corner of the compartment. \
\
\'93Thanks,\'94 said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of \
his eyes. \
\
\'93What\'92s that?\'94 said one of the twins suddenly, \
pointing at Harry\'92s lightning scar. \
\
\'93Blimey,\'94 said the other twin. \'93Are you \'97 ?\'94 \
\
\'93He is,\'94 said the first twin. \'93Aren\'92t you?\'94 he added to \
Harry. \
\
\'93What?\'94 said Harry. \
\
Page | 105 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93 Harry Potter,\'94 chorused the twins. \
\
\'93Oh, him,\'94 said Harry. \'93I mean, yes, I am.\'94 \
\
The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself \
turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating \
in through the train\'92s open door. \
\
\'93Fred? George? Are you there?\'94 \
\
\'93Coming, Mom.\'94 \
\
With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the \
train. \
\
Harry sat down next to the window where, half \
hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the \
platform and hear what they were saying. Their \
mother had just taken out her handkerchief. \
\
\'93Ron, you\'92ve got something on your nose.\'94 \
\
The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she \
grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose. \
\
\'93Mom \'97 geroff.\'94 He wriggled free. \
\
\'93Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?\'94 \
said one of the twins. \
\
\'93Shut up,\'94 said Ron. \
\
\'93Where\'92s Percy?\'94 said their mother. \
\
\'93He\'92s coming now.\'94 \
\
The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had \
already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts \
\
\
\
Page | 106 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
robes, and Harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge \
on his chest with the letter P on it. \
\
\'93Can\'92t stay long, Mother,\'94 he said. \'93I\'92m up front, the \
prefects have got two compartments to themselves \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?\'94 said one of the twins, \
with an air of great surprise. \'93You should have said \
something, we had no idea.\'94 \
\
\'93Hang on, I think I remember him saying something \
about it,\'94 said the other twin. \'93Once \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Or twice \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93A minute \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93All summer \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Oh, shut up,\'94 said Percy the Prefect. \
\
\'93How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?\'94 said one \
of the twins. \
\
\'93Because he\'92s a prefect,\'94 said their mother fondly. \'93All \
right, dear, well, have a good term \'97 send me an owl \
when you get there.\'94 \
\
She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she \
turned to the twins. \
\
\'93Now, you two \'97 this year, you behave yourselves. If I \
get one more owl telling me you\'92ve \'97 you\'92ve blown up \
a toilet or \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Blown up a toilet? We\'92ve never blown up a toilet.\'94 \
\'93Great idea though, thanks, Mom.\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 107 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93It\'92s not funny. And look after Ron.\'94 \
\
\'93Don\'92t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.\'94 \
\
\'93Shut up,\'94 said Ron again. He was almost as tall as \
the twins already and his nose was still pink where \
his mother had rubbed it. \
\
\'93Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on \
the train?\'94 \
\
Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn\'92t see him \
looking. \
\
\'93You know that black-haired boy who was near us in \
the station? Know who he is?\'94 \
\
\'93Who?\'94 \
\
\'93 Harry Potted\'94 \
\
Harry heard the little girl\'92s voice. \
\
\'93Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, \
oh please. ...\'94 \
\
\'93You\'92ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy \
isn\'92t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, \
Fred? How do you know?\'94 \
\
\'93Asked him. Saw his scar. It\'92s really there \'97 like \
lightning.\'94 \
\
\'93Poor dear \'97 no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He \
was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the \
platform.\'94 \
\
\'93Never mind that, do you think he remembers what \
You-Know-Who looks like?\'94 \
\
Page | 108 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Their mother suddenly became very stern. \
\
\
\
\'93I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don\'92t you dare. As \
though he needs reminding of that on his first day at \
school.\'94 \
\
\'93All right, keep your hair on.\'94 \
\
A whistle sounded. \
\
\'93Hurry up!\'94 their mother said, and the three boys \
clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the \
window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their \
younger sister began to cry. \
\
\'93Don\'92t, Ginny, we\'92ll send you loads of owls.\'94 \
\
\'93Well send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.\'94 \
\
\'93 Georg e\\\'94 \
\
\'93Only joking, Mom.\'94 \
\
The train began to move. Harry saw the boys\'92 mother \
waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, \
running to keep up with the train until it gathered too \
much speed, then she fell back and waved. \
\
Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as \
the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the \
window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He \
didn\'92t know what he was going to \'97 but it had to be \
better than what he was leaving behind. \
\
The door of the compartment slid open and the \
youngest redheaded boy came in. \
\
\'93Anyone sitting there?\'94 he asked, pointing at the seat \
opposite Harry. \'93Everywhere else is full.\'94 \
\
Page | 109 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He \
glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the \
window, pretending he hadn\'92t looked. Harry saw he \
still had a black mark on his nose. \
\
\'93Hey, Ron.\'94 \
\
The twins were back. \
\
\'93Listen, we\'92re going down the middle of the train \'97 \
\
Lee Jordan\'92s got a giant tarantula down there.\'94 \
\
\'93Right,\'94 mumbled Ron. \
\
\'93Harry,\'94 said the other twin, \'93did we introduce \
ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, \
our brother. See you later, then.\'94 \
\
\'93Bye,\'94 said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the \
compartment door shut behind them. \
\
\'93Are you really Harry Potter?\'94 Ron blurted out. \
\
Harry nodded. \
\
\'93Oh \'97 well, I thought it might be one of Fred and \
George\'92s jokes,\'94 said Ron. \'93And have you really got \'97 \
you know ...\'94 \
\
He pointed at Harry\'92s forehead. \
\
Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning \
scar. Ron stared. \
\
\'93So that\'92s where You-Know-Who \'97 ?\'94 \
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said Harry, \'93but I can\'92t remember it.\'94 \
\
\'93Nothing?\'94 said Ron eagerly. \
\
Page | 110 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Well \'97 I remember a lot of green light, but nothing \
else.\'94 \
\
\
\
\'93Wow,\'94 said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few \
moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized \
what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the \
window again. \
\
\'93Are all your family wizards?\'94 asked Harry, who found \
Ron just as interesting as Ron found him. \
\
\'93Er \'97 yes, I think so,\'94 said Ron. \'93I think Mom\'92s got a \
second cousin who\'92s an accountant, but we never talk \
about him.\'94 \
\
\'93So you must know loads of magic already.\'94 \
\
The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding \
families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked \
about. \
\
\'93I heard you went to live with Muggles,\'94 said Ron. \
\'93What are they like?\'94 \
\
\'93Horrible \'97 well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle \
and cousin are, though. Wish I\'92d had three wizard \
brothers.\'94 \
\
\'93Five,\'94 said Ron. For some reason, he was looking \
gloomy. \'93I\'92m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. \
You could say I\'92ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and \
Charlie have already left \'97 Bill was head boy and \
Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy\'92s a \
prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they \
still get really good marks and everyone thinks they\'92re \
really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the \
others, but if I do, it\'92s no big deal, because they did it \
first. You never get anything new, either, with five \
\
Page | 111 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
brothers. I\'92ve got Bill\'92s old robes, Charlie\'92s old wand, \
and Percy\'92s old rat.\'94 \
\
Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat \
gray rat, which was asleep. \
\
\'93His name\'92s Scabbers and he\'92s useless, he hardly ever \
wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being \
made a prefect, but they couldn\'92t aff \'97 I mean, I got \
Scabbers instead.\'94 \
\
Ron\'92s ears went pink. He seemed to think he\'92d said \
too much, because he went back to staring out of the \
window. \
\
Harry didn\'92t think there was anything wrong with not \
being able to afford an owl. After all, he\'92d never had \
any money in his life until a month ago, and he told \
Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley\'92s old clothes \
and never getting proper birthday presents. This \
seemed to cheer Ron up. \
\
"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn\'92t know anything \
about being a wizard or about my parents or \
Voldemort \'97 \'94 \
\
Ron gasped. \
\
\'93What?\'94 said Harry. \
\
\'93 You said You-Know-Who\'92s name\\\'94 said Ron, sounding \
both shocked and impressed. \'93I\'92d have thought you, \
of all people \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93I\'92m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the \
name,\'94 said Harry, \'93I just never knew you shouldn\'92t. \
See what I mean? I\'92ve got loads to learn. ... I bet,\'94 he \
added, voicing for the first time something that had \
\
\
\
Page | 112 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
been worrying him a lot lately, \'93I bet I\'92m the worst in \
the class.\'94 \
\
\'93You won\'92t be. There\'92s loads of people who come from \
Muggle families and they learn quick enough.\'94 \
\
While they had been talking, the train had carried \
them out of London. Now they were speeding past \
fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a \
time, watching the fields and lanes flick past. \
\
Around half past twelve there was a great clattering \
outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman \
slid back their door and said, \'93Anything off the cart, \
dears?\'94 \
\
Harry, who hadn\'92t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, \
but Ron\'92s ears went pink again and he muttered that \
he\'92d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the \
corridor. \
\
He had never had any money for candy with the \
Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with \
gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars \
Bars as he could carry \'97 but the woman didn\'92t have \
Mars Bars. What she did have were Bertie Bott\'92s \
Every Flavor Beans, Drooble\'92s Best Blowing Gum, \
Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, \
Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things \
Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss \
anything, he got some of everything and paid the \
woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts. \
\
Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the \
compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat. \
\
\'93Hungry, are you?\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 113 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Starving,\'94 said Harry, taking a large bite out of a \
pumpkin pasty. \
\
Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped \
it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one \
of them apart and said, \'93She always forgets I don\'92t \
like corned beef.\'94 \
\
\'93Swap you for one of these,\'94 said Harry, holding up a \
pasty. \'93Go on \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93You don\'92t want this, it\'92s all dry,\'94 said Ron. \'93She \
hasn\'92t got much time,\'94 he added quickly, \'93you know, \
with five of us.\'94 \
\
\'93Go on, have a pasty,\'94 said Harry, who had never had \
anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share \
it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, \
eating their way through all Harry\'92s pasties, cakes, \
and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten). \
\
\'93What are these?\'94 Harry asked Ron, holding up a \
pack of Chocolate Frogs. \'93They\'92re not really frogs, are \
they?\'94 He was starting to feel that nothing would \
surprise him. \
\
\'93No,\'94 said Ron. \'93But see what the card is. I\'92m missing \
Agrippa.\'94 \
\
\'93What?\'94 \
\
\'93Oh, of course, you wouldn\'92t know \'97 Chocolate Frogs \
have cards inside them, you know, to collect \'97 \
famous witches and wizards. I\'92ve got about five \
hundred, but I haven\'92t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.\'94 \
\
Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up \
the card. It showed a man\'92s face. He wore half-moon \
glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver \
\
Page | 114 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture \
was the name Albus Dumbledore. \
\
\
\
\'93So this is Dumbledore!\'94 said Harry. \
\
\'93Don\'92t tell me you\'92d never heard of Dumbledore!\'94 said \
Ron. \'93Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa \'97 thanks \
\
\
\
Harry turned over his card and read: \
\
ALBUS DUMBLEDORE \
\
CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS \
\
Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern \
times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his \
defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the \
discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\'92s blood, and his \
work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. \
Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten \
pin bowling. \
\
Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his \
astonishment, that Dumbledore \'92s face had \
disappeared. \
\
\'93He\'92s gone!\'94 \
\
\'93Well, you can\'92t expect him to hang around all day,\'94 \
said Ron. \'93He\'92ll be back. No, I\'92ve got Morgana again \
and I\'92ve got about six of her ... do you want it? You \
can start collecting.\'94 \
\
Ron\'92s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs \
waiting to be unwrapped. \
\
\'93Help yourself,\'94 said Harry. \'93But in, you know, the \
Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.\'94 \
\
Page | 115 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Do they? What, they don\'92t move at all?\'94 Ron sounded \
amazed. \'93Weird).\'94 \
\
\
\
Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the \
picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron \
was more interested in eating the frogs than looking \
at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry \
couldn\'92t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only \
Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcraft, \
Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He \
finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, \
who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie \
Bott\'92s Every Flavor Beans. \
\
\'93You want to be careful with those,\'94 Ron warned \
Harry. \'93When they say every flavor, they mean every \
flavor \'97 you know, you get all the ordinary ones like \
chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then \
you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George \
reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.\'94 \
\
Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, \
and bit into a corner. \
\
\'93Bleaaargh \'97 see? Sprouts.\'94 \
\
They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. \
Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, \
curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave \
enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron \
wouldn\'92t touch, which turned out to be pepper. \
\
The countryside now flying past the window was \
becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there \
were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills. \
\
There was a knock on the door of their compartment \
and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on \
\
Page | 116 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
platform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked \
tearful. \
\
\
\
\'93Sorry,\'94 he said, \'93but have you seen a toad at all?\'94 \
\
When they shook their heads, he wailed, \'93I\'92ve lost \
him! He keeps getting away from me!\'94 \
\
\'93Hell turn up,\'94 said Harry. \
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said the boy miserably. \'93Well, if you see him ...\'94 \
He left. \
\
\'93Don\'92t know why he\'92s so bothered,\'94 said Ron. \'93If I\'92d \
brought a toad I\'92d lose it as quick as I could. Mind \
you, I brought Scabbers, so I can\'92t talk.\'94 \
\
The rat was still snoozing on Ron\'92s lap. \
\
\'93He might have died and you wouldn\'92t know the \
difference,\'94 said Ron in disgust. \'93I tried to turn him \
yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but \
the spell didn\'92t work. I\'92ll show you, look ...\'94 \
\
He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a \
very battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places \
and something white was glinting at the end. \
\
\'93Unicorn hair\'92s nearly poking out. Anyway \'97 \'94 \
\
He had just raised his wand when the compartment \
door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but \
this time he had a girl with him. She was already \
wearing her new Hogwarts robes. \
\
\'93Has anyone seen a toad? Neville\'92s lost one,\'94 she said. \
She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown \
hair, and rather large front teeth. \
\
Page | 117 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93We\'92ve already told him we haven\'92t seen it,\'94 said Ron, \
but the girl wasn\'92t listening, she was looking at the \
wand in his hand. \
\
\'93Oh, are you doing magic? Let\'92s see it, then.\'94 \
\
She sat down. Ron looked taken aback. \
\
\'93Er \'97 all right.\'94 \
\
He cleared his throat. \
\
\'93 Sunshine , daisies, butter mellow, \
\
Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\'94 \
\
He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers \
stayed gray and fast asleep. \
\
\'93Are you sure that\'92s a real spell?\'94 said the girl. \'93Well, \
it\'92s not very good, is it? I\'92ve tried a few simple spells \
just for practice and it\'92s all worked for me. Nobody in \
my family\'92s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise \
when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of \
course, I mean, it\'92s the very best school of witchcraft \
there is, I\'92ve heard \'97 I\'92ve learned all our course books \
by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough \'97 I\'92m \
Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?\'94 \
\
She said all this very fast. \
\
Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his \
stunned face that he hadn\'92t learned all the course \
books by heart either. \
\
\'93I\'92m Ron Weasley,\'94 Ron muttered. \
\
\'93Harry Potter,\'94 said Harry. \
\
\
\
Page | 118 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Are you really?\'94 said Hermione. \'93I know all about \
you, of course \'97 I got a few extra books for \
background reading, and you\'92re in Modern Magical \
History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and \
Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.\'94 \
\
\'93Am I?\'94 said Harry, feeling dazed. \
\
\'93Goodness, didn\'92t you know, I\'92d have found out \
everything I could if it was me,\'94 said Hermione. \'93Do \
either of you know what House you\'92ll be in? I\'92ve been \
asking around, and I hope I\'92m in Gryffindor, it sounds \
by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, \
but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn\'92t be too bad. ... \
Anyway, we\'92d better go and look for Neville\'92s toad. \
\
You two had better change, you know, I expect we\'92ll \
be there soon.\'94 \
\
And she left, taking the toadless boy with her. \
\
\'93Whatever House I\'92m in, I hope she\'92s not in it,\'94 said \
Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. \'93Stupid \
spell \'97 George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a \
dud.\'94 \
\
\'93What House are your brothers in?\'94 asked Harry. \
\
\'93Gryffindor,\'94 said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling \
on him again. \'93Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don\'92t \
know what they\'92ll say if I\'92m not. I don\'92t suppose \
Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put \
me in Slytherin.\'94 \
\
\'93That\'92s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was \
in?\'94 \
\
\
\
\'93Yeah,\'94 said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, \
looking depressed. \
\
\
\
Page | 119 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93You know, I think the ends of Scabbers\'92 whiskers are \
a bit lighter,\'94 said Harry, trying to take Ron\'92s mind off \
Houses. \'93So what do your oldest brothers do now that \
they\'92ve left, anyway?\'94 \
\
Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he\'92d \
finished school. \
\
\'93Charlie\'92s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill\'92s in \
Africa doing something for Gringotts,\'94 said Ron. \'93Did \
you hear about Gringotts? It\'92s been all over the Daily \
Prophet, but I don\'92t suppose you get that with the \
Muggles \'97 someone tried to rob a high security \
vault.\'94 \
\
Harry stared. \
\
\'93Really? What happened to them?\'94 \
\
\'93Nothing, that\'92s why it\'92s such big news. They haven\'92t \
been caught. My dad says it must\'92ve been a powerful \
Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don\'92t \
think they took anything, that\'92s what\'92s odd. \'92Course, \
everyone gets scared when something like this \
happens in case You-Know-Who\'92s behind it.\'94 \
\
Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was \
starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know- \
Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of \
entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more \
comfortable saying \'93Voldemort\'94 without worrying. \
\
\'93What\'92s your Quidditch team?\'94 Ron asked. \
\
\'93Er \'97 I don\'92t know any,\'94 Harry confessed. \
\
\'93What!\'94 Ron looked dumbfounded. \'93Oh, you wait, it\'92s \
the best game in the world \'97 \'94 And he was off, \
explaining all about the four balls and the positions of \
\
Page | 120 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
the seven players, describing famous games he\'92d been \
to with his brothers and the broomstick he\'92d like to \
get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry \
through the finer points of the game when the \
compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn\'92t \
Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this \
time. \
\
Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle \
one at once: It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin\'92s \
robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more \
interest than he\'92d shown back in Diagon Alley. \
\
\'93Is it true?\'94 he said. \'93They\'92re saying all down the train \
that Harry Potter\'92s in this compartment. So it\'92s you, is \
it?\'94 \
\
\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. \
Both of them were thickset and looked extremely \
mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they \
looked like bodyguards. \
\
\'93Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\'94 said the pale \
boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. \
\
\'93And my names Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.\'94 \
\
Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been \
hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him. \
\
\'93Think my name\'92s funny, do you? No need to ask who \
you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red \
hair, freckles, and more children than they can \
afford.\'94 \
\
He turned back to Harry. \'93You\'92ll soon find out some \
wizarding families are much better than others, \
\
Potter. You don\'92t want to go making friends with the \
wrong sort. I can help you there.\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 121 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
He held out his hand to shake Harry\'92s, but Harry \
didn\'92t take it. \
\
\'93I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, \
thanks,\'94 he said coolly. \
\
Draco Malfoy didn\'92t go red, but a pink tinge appeared \
in his pale cheeks. \
\
\'93I\'92d be careful if I were you, Potter,\'94 he said slowly. \
\'93Unless you\'92re a bit politer you\'92ll go the same way as \
your parents. They didn\'92t know what was good for \
them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the \
Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it\'92ll rub off on you.\'94 \
\
Both Harry and Ron stood up. \
\
\'93Say that again,\'94 Ron said, his face as red as his hair. \
\
\'93Oh, you\'92re going to fight us, are you?\'94 Malfoy \
sneered. \
\
\'93Unless you get out now,\'94 said Harry, more bravely \
than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot \
bigger than him or Ron. \
\
\'93But we don\'92t feel like leaving, do we, boys? We\'92ve \
eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.\'94 \
\
Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to \
Ron \'97 Ron leapt forward, but before he\'92d so much as \
touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell. \
\
Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp \
little teeth sunk deep into Goyle \'92s knuckle \'97 Crabbe \
and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers \
round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally \
flew off and hit the window, all three of them \
disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were \
Page | 122 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps \
they\'92d heard footsteps, because a second later, \
Hermione Granger had come in. \
\
\'93What has been going on?\'94 she said, looking at the \
sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers \
by his tail. \
\
\'93I think he\'92s been knocked out,\'94 Ron said to Harry. \
\
He looked closer at Scabbers. \'93No \'97 I don\'92t believe it \
\'97 he\'92s gone back to sleep.\'94 \
\
And so he had. \
\
\'93You\'92ve met Malfoy before?\'94 \
\
Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley. \
\
\'93I\'92ve heard of his family,\'94 said Ron darkly. \'93They were \
some of the first to come back to our side after You- \
Know-Who disappeared. Said they\'92d been bewitched. \
My dad doesn\'92t believe it. He says Malfoy\'92s father \
didn\'92t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.\'94 He \
turned to Hermione. \'93Can we help you with \
something?\'94 \
\
\'93You\'92d better hurry up and put your robes on, I\'92ve \
just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he \
says we\'92re nearly there. You haven\'92t been fighting, \
have you? You\'92ll be in trouble before we even get \
there!\'94 \
\
\'93Scabbers has been fighting, not us,\'94 said Ron, \
scowling at her. \'93Would you mind leaving while we \
change?\'94 \
\
\'93All right \'97 I only came in here because people \
outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and \
down the corridors,\'94 said Hermione in a sniffy voice. \
\
Page | 123 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93And you\'92ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you \
know?\'94 \
\
\
\
Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the \
window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains \
and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did \
seem to be slowing down. \
\
He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their \
long black robes. Ron\'92s were a bit short for him, you \
could see his sneakers underneath them. \
\
A voice echoed through the train: \'93We will be reaching \
Hogwarts in five minutes\'92 time. Please leave your \
luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school \
separately.\'94 \
\
Harry\'92s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he \
saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed \
their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined \
the crowd thronging the corridor. \
\
The train slowed right down and finally stopped. \
People pushed their way toward the door and out on \
to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold \
night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads \
of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: \
\'93Firs\'92 years! Firs\'92 years over here! All right there, \
Harry?\'94 \
\
Hagrid\'92s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads. \
\
\'93C\'92mon, follow me \'97 any more firs\'92 years? Mind yer \
step, now! Firs\'92 years follow me!\'94 \
\
Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down \
what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so \
dark on either side of them that Harry thought there \
must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. \
\
Page | 124 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once \
or twice. \
\
\
\
\'93Yeh\'92ll get yer firs\'92 sight o\'92 Hogwarts in a sec,\'94 Hagrid \
called over his shoulder, \'93jus\'92 round this bend here.\'94 \
\
There was a loud \'93Oooooh!\'94 \
\
The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge \
of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain \
on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry \
sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers. \
\
\'93No more\'92n four to a boat!\'94 Hagrid called, pointing to \
a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. \
Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville \
and Hermione. \
\
\'93Everyone in?\'94 shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to \
himself. \'93Right then \'97 FORWARD!\'94 \
\
And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, \
gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as \
glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great \
castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed \
nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood. \
\
\'93Heads down!\'94 yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached \
the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats \
carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide \
opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a \
dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right \
underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of \
underground harbor, where they clambered out onto \
rocks and pebbles. \
\
\'93Oy, you there! Is this your toad?\'94 said Hagrid, who \
was checking the boats as people climbed out of \
them. \
\
Page | 125 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Trevor!\'94 cried Neville blissfully, holding out his \
hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the \
rock after Hagrid\'92s lamp, coming out at last onto \
smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle. \
\
They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded \
around the huge, oak front door. \
\
\'93Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?\'94 \
\
Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times \
on the castle door. \
\
\

\
\
\
THE SORTING HAT \
\
The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired \
witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a \
very stern face and Harry\'92s first thought was that this \
was not someone to cross. \
\
\'93The firs\'92 years, Professor McGonagall,\'94 said Hagrid. \
\
\'93Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\'94 \
\
She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so \
big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys\'92 \
house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming \
torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too \
high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase \
facing them led to the upper floors. \
\
They followed Professor McGonagall across the \
flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of \
hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right \'97 the \
rest of the school must already be here \'97 but \
Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a \
small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, \
Page | 127 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
standing rather closer together than they would \
usually have done, peering about nervously. \
\
\'93Welcome to Hogwarts,\'94 said Professor McGonagall. \
\'93The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but \
before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will \
be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very \
important ceremony because, while you are here, \
your House will be something like your family within \
Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your \
House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free \
time in your House common room. \
\
\'93The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, \
Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own \
noble history and each has produced outstanding \
witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your \
triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule- \
breaking will lose House points. At the end of the \
year, the House with the most points is awarded the \
House cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a \
credit to whichever House becomes yours. \
\
\'93The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few \
minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest \
you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can \
while you are waiting.\'94 \
\
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville\'92s cloak, \
which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron\'92s \
smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his \
hair. \
\
\'93I shall return when we are ready for you,\'94 said \
Professor McGonagall. \'93Please wait quietly.\'94 \
\
She left the chamber. Harry swallowed. \
\
\
\

\
\
\
\
\'93How exactly do they sort us into Houses?\'94 he asked \
Ron. \
\
\
\
\'93Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but \
I think he was joking.\'94 \
\
Harry\'92s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of \
the whole school? But he didn\'92t know any magic yet \
\'97 what on earth would he have to do? He hadn\'92t \
expected something like this the moment they \
arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that \
everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking \
much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering \
very fast about all the spells she\'92d learned and \
wondering which one she\'92d need. Harry tried hard not \
to listen to her. He\'92d never been more nervous, never, \
not even when he\'92d had to take a school report home \
to the Dursleys saying that he\'92d somehow turned his \
teachers wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. \
Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come \
back and lead him to his doom. \
\
Then something happened that made him jump about \
a foot in the air \'97 several people behind him \
screamed. \
\
\'93What the \'97 ?\'94 \
\
He gasped. So did the people around him. About \
twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back \
wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they \
glided across the room talking to one another and \
hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be \
arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was \
saying: \'93Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give \
him a second chance \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93My dear Friar, haven\'92t we given Peeves all the \
chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and \
\
Page | 129 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
you know, he\'92s not really even a ghost \'97 I say, what \
are you all doing here?\'94 \
\
\
\
A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly \
noticed the first years. \
\
Nobody answered. \
\
\'93New students!\'94 said the Fat Friar, smiling around at \
them. \'93About to be Sorted, I suppose?\'94 \
\
A few people nodded mutely. \
\
\'93Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\'94 said the Friar. \'93My old \
House, you know.\'94 \
\
\'93Move along now,\'94 said a sharp voice. \'93The Sorting \
Ceremony\'92s about to start.\'94 \
\
Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the \
ghosts floated away through the opposite wall. \
\
\'93Now, form a line,\'94 Professor McGonagall told the first \
years, \'93and follow me.\'94 \
\
Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, \
Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with \
Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, \
back across the hall, and through a pair of double \
doors into the Great Hall. \
\
Harry had never even imagined such a strange and \
splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands \
of candles that were floating in midair over four long \
tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. \
These tables were laid with glittering golden plates \
and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long \
table where the teachers were sitting. Professor \
McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they \
Page | 130 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
came to a halt in a line facing the other students, \
with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces \
staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the \
flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among \
the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to \
avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and \
saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard \
Hermione whisper, \'93It\'92s bewitched to look like the sky \
outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.\'94 \
\
It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, \
and that the Great Hall didn\'92t simply open on to the \
heavens. \
\
Harry quickly looked down again as Professor \
McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front \
of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed \
wizard\'92s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and \
extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn\'92t have let it in \
the house. \
\
Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry \
thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing \'97 \
noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at \
the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there \
was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip \
near the brim opened wide like a mouth \'97 and the \
hat began to sing: \
\
\'93Oh, you may not think I\'92m pretty, \
\
But don\'92t judge on what you see, \
\
I\'92ll eat myself if you can find \
\
A smarter hat than me. \
\
You can keep your bowlers black, \
\
\
\
Page | 131 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Your top hats sleek and tall, \
\
For I\'92m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat \
And I can cap them all. \
\
There\'92s nothing hidden in your head \
The Sorting Hat can\'92t see, \
\
So try me on and I will tell you \
Where you ought to be. \
\
You might belong in Gryffindor, \
\
Where dwell the brave at heart, \
\
Their daring, nerve, and chivalry \
Set Gryffindors apart; \
\
You might belong in Hufflepuff, \
\
Where they are just and loyal, \
\
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true \
And unafraid of toil; \
\
Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, \
\
If you\'92ve a ready mind, \
\
Where those of wit and learning, \
\
Will always find their kind; \
\
Or perhaps in Slytherin \
\
Page | 132 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
You\'92ll make your real friends, \
\
Those cunning folk use any means \
To achieve their ends. \
\
So put me on! Don\'92t be afraid l\\ \
\
And don\'92t get in a flap\\ \
\
You\'92re in safe hands (though I have none) \
\
For I\'92m a Thinking Cap\\\'94 \
\
The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished \
its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then \
became quite still again. \
\
\'93So we\'92ve just got to try on the hat!\'94 Ron whispered to \
Harry. \'93I\'92ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling \
a troll.\'94 \
\
Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot \
better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they \
could have tried it on without everyone watching. The \
hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn\'92t feel \
brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If \
only the hat had mentioned a House for people who \
felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for \
him. \
\
Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a \
long roll of parchment. \
\
\'93When I call your name, you will put on the hat and \
sit on the stool to be sorted,\'94 she said. \'93Abbott, \
Hannah!\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 133 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of \
line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her \
eyes, and sat down. A moment\'92s pause \'97 \
\
\'93HUFFLEPUFF!\'94 shouted the hat. \
\
The table on the right cheered and clapped as \
Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. \
\
Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at \
her. \
\
\'93Bones, Susan!\'94 \
\
\'93HUFFLEPUFF!\'94 shouted the hat again, and Susan \
scuttled off to sit next to Hannah. \
\
\'93Boot, Terry!\'94 \
\
\'93RAVENCLAW!\'94 \
\
The table second from the left clapped this time; \
several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with \
Terry as he joined them. \
\
\'93Brocklehurst, Mandy\'94 went to Ravenclaw too, but \
\'93Brown, Lavender\'94 became the first new Gryffindor, \
and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; \
Harry could see Ron\'92s twin brothers catcalling. \
\
\'93Bulstrode, Millicent\'94 then became a Slytherin. \
Perhaps it was Harry\'92s imagination, after all he\'92d \
heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked \
like an unpleasant lot. \
\
He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He \
remembered being picked for teams during gym at his \
old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not \
because he was no good, but because no one wanted \
Dudley to think they liked him. \
\
Page | 134 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Finch-Fletchley, Justin!\'94 \
\
\
\
\'93HUFFLEPUFF!\'94 \
\
Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the \
House at once, but at others it took a little while to \
decide. \'93Finnigan, Seamus,\'94 the sandy-haired boy \
next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a \
whole minute before the hat declared him a \
Gryffindor. \
\
\'93Granger, Hermione!\'94 \
\
Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat \
eagerly on her head. \
\
\'93GRYFFINDOR!\'94 shouted the hat. Ron groaned. \
\
A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts \
always do when you\'92re very nervous. What if he \
wasn\'92t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with \
the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor \
McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had \
obviously been a mistake and he\'92d better get back on \
the train? \
\
When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his \
toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. \
The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When \
it finally shouted, \'93GRYFFINDOR,\'94 Neville ran off still \
wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter \
to give it to \'93MacDougal, Morag.\'94 \
\
Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called \
and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched \
his head when it screamed, \'93SLYTHERIN!\'94 \
\
Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, \
looking pleased with himself. \
\
Page | 135 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
There weren\'92t many people left now. \
\
\
\
\'93Moon\'94 , \'93Nott\'94 ... , \'93Parkinson\'94 ... , then a pair of \
twin girls, \'93Path\'94 and \'93Path\'94 ... , then \'93Perks, Sally- \
Anne\'94 . . . , and then, at last \'97 \
\
\'93Potter, Harry!\'94 \
\
As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke \
out like little hissing fires all over the hall. \
\
\'93 Potter , did she say?\'94 \
\
\'93 The Harry Potter?\'94 \
\
The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over \
his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a \
good look at him. Next second he was looking at the \
black inside of the hat. He waited. \
\
\'93Hmm,\'94 said a small voice in his ear. \'93Difficult. Very \
difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind \
either. There\'92s talent, oh my goodness, yes \'97 and a \
nice thirst to prove yourself, now that\'92s interesting. ... \
So where shall I put you?\'94 \
\
Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not \
Slytherin, not Slytherin. \
\
\'93Not Slytherin, eh?\'94 said the small voice. \'93Are you \
sure? You could be great, you know, it\'92s all here in \
your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to \
greatness, no doubt about that \'97 no? Well, if you\'92re \
sure \'97 better be GRYFFINDOR!\'94 \
\
Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole \
hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward \
the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been \
chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed \
\
Page | 136 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the \
Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while \
the Weasley twins yelled, \'93We got Potter! We got \
Potter!\'94 Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff \
he\'92d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving \
Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he\'92d just plunged it \
into a bucket of ice-cold water. \
\
He could see the High Table properly now. At the end \
nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave \
him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, \
in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, \
sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once \
from the card he\'92d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on \
the train. Dumbledore\'92s silver hair was the only thing \
in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. \
Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous \
young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking \
very peculiar in a large purple turban. \
\
And now there were only four people left to be sorted. \
\'93Thomas, Dean,\'94 a Black boy even taller than Ron, \
joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. \'93Turpin, Lisa,\'94 \
became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron\'92s turn. He \
was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers \
under the table and a second later the hat had \
shouted, \'93GRYFFINDOR!\'94 \
\
Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed \
into the chair next to him. \
\
\'93Well done, Ron, excellent,\'94 said Percy Weasley \
pompously across Harry as \'93Zabini, Blaise,\'94 was \
made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her \
scroll and took the Sorting Hat away. \
\
Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had \
only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin \
pasties seemed ages ago. \
\
Page | 137 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was \
beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if \
nothing could have pleased him more than to see \
them all there. \
\
\'93Welcome!\'94 he said. \'93Welcome to a new year at \
Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like \
to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! \
\
Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! \
\
\'93Thank you!\'94 \
\
He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. \
Harry didn\'92t know whether to laugh or not. \
\
\'93Is he \'97 a bit mad?\'94 he asked Percy uncertainly. \
\
\'93Mad?\'94 said Percy airily. \'93He\'92s a genius! Best wizard \
in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, \
Harry?\'94 \
\
Harry\'92s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him \
were now piled with food. He had never seen so many \
things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast \
chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, \
bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, \
fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, \
ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint \
humbugs. \
\
The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but \
he\'92d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. \
Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really \
wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate \
with a bit of everything except the peppermints and \
began to eat. It was all delicious. \
\
\'93That does look good,\'94 said the ghost in the ruff sadly, \
watching Harry cut up his steak. \
\
Page | 138 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Can\'92t you \'97 ?\'94 \
\
\
\
\'93I haven\'92t eaten for nearly five hundred years,\'94 said \
the ghost. \'93I don\'92t need to, of course, but one does \
miss it. I don\'92t think I\'92ve introduced myself? Sir \
Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. \
Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.\'94 \
\
\'93I know who you are!\'94 said Ron suddenly. \'93My \
brothers told me about you \'97 you\'92re Nearly Headless \
Nick!\'94 \
\
\'93I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy \
\'97 \'94 the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus \
Finnigan interrupted. \
\
\'93Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?\'94 \
\
Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little \
chat wasn\'92t going at all the way he wanted. \
\
\'93Like this,\'94 he said irritably. He seized his left ear and \
pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell \
onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone \
had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it \
properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on \
their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head \
back onto his neck, coughed, and said, \'93So \'97 new \
Gryffindors! I hope you\'92re going to help us win the \
House Championship this year? Gryffindors have \
never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have \
got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron\'92s \
becoming almost unbearable \'97 he\'92s the Slytherin \
ghost.\'94 \
\
Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a \
horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a \
gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He \
was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to \
\
Page | 139 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
see, didn\'92t look too pleased with the seating \
arrangements. \
\
\'93How did he get covered in blood?\'94 asked Seamus \
with great interest. \
\
\'93I\'92ve never asked,\'94 said Nearly Headless Nick \
delicately. \
\
When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the \
remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving \
them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the \
desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor \
you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate \
eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell- \
0, rice pudding ... \
\
As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk \
turned to their families. \
\
\'93I\'92m half-and-half,\'94 said Seamus. \'93Me dad\'92s a Muggle. \
Mom didn\'92t tell him she was a witch \'92til after they \
were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.\'94 \
\
The others laughed. \
\
\'93What about you, Neville?\'94 said Ron. \
\
\'93Well, my gran brought me up and she\'92s a witch,\'94 \
said Neville, \'93but the family thought I was all- Muggle \
for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me \
off my guard and force some magic out of me \'97 he \
pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly \
drowned \'97 but nothing happened until I was eight. \
Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was \
hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles \
when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue \
and he accidentally let go. But I bounced \'97 all the \
way down the garden and into the road. They were all \
Page | 140 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. \
And you should have seen their faces when I got in \
here \'97 they thought I might not be magic enough to \
come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he \
bought me my toad.\'94 \
\
On Harry\'92s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione \
were talking about lessons (\'93I do hope they start right \
away, there\'92s so much to learn, I\'92m particularly \
interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning \
something into something else, of course, it\'92s \
supposed to be very difficult \'97 \'93You\'92ll be starting \
small, just matches into needles and that sort of \
thing \'97 \'94). \
\
\
\
Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, \
looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was \
drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall \
was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor \
Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a \
teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and \
sallow skin. \
\
It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher \
looked past Quirrell\'92s turban straight into Harry\'92s \
eyes \'97 and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on \
Harry\'92s forehead. \
\
\'93Ouch!\'94 Harry clapped a hand to his head. \
\
\'93What is it?\'94 asked Percy. \
\
\'93N-nothing.\'94 \
\
The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder \
to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the \
teacher\'92s look \'97 a feeling that he didn\'92t like Harry at \
all. \
\
\
\
Page | 141 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Who\'92s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\'94 he \
asked Percy. \
\
\'93Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder \
he\'92s looking so nervous, that\'92s Professor Snape. He \
teaches Potions, but he doesn\'92t want to \'97 everyone \
knows he\'92s after Quirrell\'92s job. Knows an awful lot \
about the Dark Arts, Snape.\'94 \
\
Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn\'92t \
look at him again. \
\
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor \
Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent. \
\
\'93Ahem \'97 just a few more words now that we are all \
fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to \
give you. \
\
\'93First years should note that the forest on the \
grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our \
older students would do well to remember that as \
well.\'94 \
\
Dumbledore \'92s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction \
of the Weasley twins. \
\
\'93I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to \
remind you all that no magic should be used between \
classes in the corridors. \
\
\'93Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of \
the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House \
teams should contact Madam Hooch. \
\
\'93And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third- \
floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds \
to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful \
death.\'94 \
\
Page | 142 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. \
\
\
\
\'93He\'92s not serious?\'94 he muttered to Percy. \
\
\'93Must be,\'94 said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \'93It\'92s \
odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we\'92re \
not allowed to go somewhere \'97 the forest\'92s full of \
dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he \
might have told us prefects, at least.\'94 \
\
\'93And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school \
song!\'94 cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other \
teachers\'92 smiles had become rather fixed. \
\
Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was \
trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden \
ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables \
and twisted itself, snakelike, into words. \
\
\'93Everyone pick their favorite tune,\'94 said Dumbledore, \
\'93and off we go!\'94 \
\
And the school bellowed: \
\
\'93Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, \
\
Teach us something please, \
\
Whether we be old and bald \
Or young with scabby knees, \
\
Our heads could do with filling \
With some interesting stuff, \
\
For now they\'92re bare and full of air, \
\
Dead flies and bits of fluff, \
\
Page | 143 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
So teach us things worth knowing, \
\
Bring back what we\'92ve forgot, \
\
Just do your best, we\'92ll do the rest, \
\
And learn until our brains all rot.\'94 \
\
Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, \
only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a \
very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their \
last few lines with his wand and when they had \
finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest. \
\
\'93Ah, music,\'94 he said, wiping his eyes. \'93A magic \
beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you \
trot!\'94 \
\
The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the \
chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the \
marble staircase. Harry\'92s legs were like lead again, \
but only because he was so tired and full of food. He \
was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in \
the portraits along the corridors whispered and \
pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them \
through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and \
hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, \
yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just \
wondering how much farther they had to go when \
they came to a sudden halt. \
\
A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair \
ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them \
they started throwing themselves at him. \
\
\'93Peeves,\'94 Percy whispered to the first years. \'93A \
poltergeist.\'94 He raised his voice, \'93Peeves \'97 show \
yourself.\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 144 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a \
balloon, answered. \
\
\'93Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\'94 \
\
There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark \
eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- \
legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks. \
\
\'93Oooooooh!\'94 he said, with an evil cackle. \'93Ickle \
Firsties! What fun!\'94 \
\
He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked. \
\
\'93Go away, Peeves, or the Baron\'92ll hear about this, I \
mean it!\'94 barked Percy. \
\
Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping \
the walking sticks on Neville\'92s head. They heard him \
zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed. \
\
\'93You want to watch out for Peeves,\'94 said Percy, as \
they set off again. \'93The Bloody Baron\'92s the only one \
who can control him, he won\'92t even listen to us \
prefects. Here we are.\'94 \
\
At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a \
very fat woman in a pink silk dress. \
\
\'93Password?\'94 she said. \
\
\'93Caput Draconis,\'94 said Percy, and the portrait swung \
forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all \
scrambled through it \'97 Neville needed a leg up \'97 \
and found themselves in the Gryffindor common \
room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs. \
\
Percy directed the girls through one door to their \
dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of \
\

\
a spiral staircase \'97 they were obviously in one of the \
towers \'97 they found their beds at last: five four- \
posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their \
trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk \
much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed. \
\
\'93Great food, isn\'92t it?\'94 Ron muttered to Harry through \
the hangings. \'93Get off Scabbers! He\'92s chewing my \
sheets.\'94 \
\
Harry was going to ask Ron if he\'92d had any of the \
treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once. \
\
Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he \
had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor \
Quirrell\'92s turban, which kept talking to him, telling \
him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it \
was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn\'92t want \
to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried \
to pull it off but it tightened painfully \'97 and there \
was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it \'97 \
then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, \
Snape, whose laugh became high and cold \'97 there \
was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating \
and shaking. \
\
He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he \
woke next day, he didn\'92t remember the dream at all. \

THE POTIONS MASTER \
\
\'93There, look.\'94 \
\
\'93Where?\'94 \
\
\'93Next to the tall kid with the red hair.\'94 \
\
\'93Wearing the glasses?\'94 \
\
\'93Did you see his face?\'94 \
\
\'93Did you see his scar?\'94 \
\
Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his \
dormitory the next day. People lining up outside \
classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or \
doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, \
staring. Harry wished they wouldn\'92t, because he was \
trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes. \
\
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at \
Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; \
some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some \
\
Page | 147 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to \
remember to jump. Then there were doors that \
wouldn\'92t open unless you asked politely, or tickled \
them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren\'92t \
really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It \
was also very hard to remember where anything was, \
because it all seemed to move around a lot. The \
people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, \
and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk. \
\
The ghosts didn\'92t help, either. It was always a nasty \
shock when one of them glided suddenly through a \
door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick \
was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the \
right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth \
two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him \
when you were late for class. He would drop \
wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from \
under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak \
up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \
\'93GOT YOUR CONK!\'94 \
\
Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the \
caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get \
on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. \
Filch found them trying to force their way through a \
door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to \
the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He \
wouldn\'92t believe they were lost, was sure they were \
trying to break into it on purpose, and was \
threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they \
were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing. \
\
Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust- \
colored creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like \
Filch\'92s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule \
in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she\'92d \
whisk off for Filch, who\'92d appear, wheezing, two \
seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of \

\
\
\
\
the school better than anyone (except perhaps the \
Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any \
of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was \
the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a \
good kick. \
\
And then, once you had managed to find them, there \
were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to \
magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your \
wand and saying a few funny words. \
\
They had to study the night skies through their \
telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn \
the names of different stars and the movements of the \
planets. Three times a week they went out to the \
greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, \
with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, \
where they learned how to take care of all the strange \
plants and fungi, and found out what they were used \
for. \
\
Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, \
which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor \
Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen \
asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next \
morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns \
droned on and on while they scribbled down names \
and dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the \
Oddball mixed up. \
\
Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny \
little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to \
see over his desk. At the start of their first class he \
took the roll call, and when he reached Harry\'92s name \
he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. \
\
Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had \
been quite right to think she wasn\'92t a teacher to \
\
\
\
Page | 149 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking- to \
the moment they sat down in her first class. \
\
\'93Transfiguration is some of the most complex and \
dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,\'94 she \
said. \'93Anyone messing around in my class will leave \
and not come back. You have been warned.\'94 \
\
Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. \
They were all very impressed and couldn\'92t wait to get \
started, but soon realized they weren\'92t going to be \
changing the furniture into animals for a long time. \
After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each \
given a match and started trying to turn it into a \
needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione \
Granger had made any difference to her match; \
Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had \
gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare \
smile. \
\
The class everyone had really been looking forward to \
was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell\'92s \
lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom \
smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to \
ward off a vampire he\'92d met in Romania and was \
afraid would be coming back to get him one of these \
days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him \
by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of \
a troublesome zombie, but they weren\'92t sure they \
believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus \
Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had \
fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started \
talking about the weather; for another, they had \
noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, \
and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full \
of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected \
wherever he went. \
\
\
\

\
\
\
\
Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn\'92t \
miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come \
from Muggle families and, like him, hadn\'92t had any \
idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so \
much to learn that even people like Ron didn\'92t have \
much of a head start. \
\
Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They \
finally managed to find their way down to the Great \
Hall for breakfast without getting lost once. \
\
\'93What have we got today?\'94 Harry asked Ron as he \
poured sugar on his porridge. \
\
\'93Double Potions with the Slytherins,\'94 said Ron. \
\'93Snape\'92s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always \
favors them \'97 we\'92ll be able to see if it\'92s true.\'94 \
\
\'93Wish McGonagall favored us,\'94 said Harry. Professor \
McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it \
hadn\'92t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of \
homework the day before. \
\
Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to \
this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on \
the first morning, when about a hundred owls had \
suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during \
breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their \
owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their \
laps. \
\
Hedwig hadn\'92t brought Harry anything so far. She \
sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of \
toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the \
other school owls. This morning, however, she \
fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar \
bowl and dropped a note onto Harry\'92s plate. Harry \
tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl: \
\
\
\
Page | 151 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Dear Harry, \
\
\
\
I know you get Friday afternoons off so would you like \
to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? \
\
I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an \
answer back with Hedwig. \
\
Hagrid \
\
Harry borrowed Ron\'92s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see \
you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off \
again. \
\
It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look \
forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to \
be the worst thing that had happened to him so far. \
\
At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the \
idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of \
the first Potions lesson, he knew he\'92d been wrong. \
Snape didn\'92t dislike Harry \'97 he hated him. \
\
Potions lessons took place down in one of the \
dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main \
castle, and would have been quite creepy enough \
without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all \
around the walls. \
\
Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the \
roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry\'92s name. \
\
\'93Ah, yes,\'94 he said softly, \'93Harry Potter. Our new \'97 \
celebrity.\'94 \
\
Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle \
sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling \
the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were \
black like Hagrid \'92s, but they had none of Hagrid \'92s \
\
Page | 152 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
warmth. They were cold and empty and made you \
think of dark tunnels. \
\
\'93You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art \
of potion-making,\'94 he began. He spoke in barely more \
than a whisper, but they caught every word \'97 like \
Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a \
class silent without effort. \'93As there is little foolish \
wand- waving here, many of you will hardly believe \
this is magic. I don\'92t expect you will really understand \
the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its \
shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that \
creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, \
ensnaring the senses. ... I can teach you how to bottle \
fame, brew glory, even stopper death \'97 if you aren\'92t \
as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to \
teach.\'94 \
\
More silence followed this little speech. Harry and \
Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione \
Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked \
desperate to start proving that she wasn\'92t a \
dunderhead. \
\
\'93Potter!\'94 said Snape suddenly. \'93What would I get if I \
added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of \
wormwood?\'94 \
\
Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry \
glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; \
Hermione \'92s hand had shot into the air. \
\
\'93I don\'92t know, sir,\'94 said Harry. \
\
Snape \'92s lips curled into a sneer. \
\
\'93Tut, tut \'97 fame clearly isn\'92t everything.\'94 \
\
He ignored Hermione \'92s hand. \
\
Page | 153 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Let\'92s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told \
you to find me a bezoar?\'94 \
\
Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it \
would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry \
didn\'92t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He \
tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who \
were shaking with laughter. \
\
\'93I don\'92t know, sir.\'94 \
\
\'93Thought you wouldn\'92t open a book before coming, \
eh, Potter?\'94 \
\
Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into \
those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at \
the Dursleys\'92, but did Snape expect him to remember \
everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and \
Fungi ? \
\
Snape was still ignoring Hermione\'92s quivering hand. \
\
\'93What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood \
and wolfsbane?\'94 \
\
At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching \
toward the dungeon ceiling. \
\
\'93I don\'92t know,\'94 said Harry quietly. \'93I think Hermione \
does, though, why don\'92t you try her?\'94 \
\
A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus\'92s eye, \
and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not \
pleased. \
\
\'93Sit down,\'94 he snapped at Hermione. \'93For your \
information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a \
sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the \
Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken \
\
Page | 154 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from \
most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they \
are the same plant, which also goes by the name of \
aconite. Well? Why aren\'92t you all copying that down?\'94 \
\
There was a sudden rummaging for quills and \
parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, \'93And a point \
will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, \
Potter.\'94 \
\
Things didn\'92t improve for the Gryffindors as the \
Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into \
pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to \
cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, \
watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake \
fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, \
whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone \
to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his \
horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a \
loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow \
managed to melt Seamus\'92s cauldron into a twisted \
blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone \
floor, burning holes in people\'92s shoes. Within \
seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools \
while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion \
when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as \
angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs. \
\
\'93Idiot boy!\'94 snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion \
away with one wave of his wand. \'93I suppose you \
added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron \
off the fire?\'94 \
\
Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over \
his nose. \
\
\'93Take him up to the hospital wing,\'94 Snape spat at \
Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who \
had been working next to Neville. \
\
Page | 155 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93You \'97 Potter \'97 why didn\'92t you tell him not to add \
the quills? Thought he\'92d make you look good if he got \
it wrong, did you? That\'92s another point you\'92ve lost for \
Gryffindor.\'94 \
\
This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to \
argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron. \
\
\'93Don\'92t push it,\'94 he muttered, \'93I\'92ve heard Snape can \
turn very nasty.\'94 \
\
As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour \
later, Harry\'92s mind was racing and his spirits were \
low. He\'92d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very \
first week \'97 why did Snape hate him so much? \
\
\'93Cheer up,\'94 said Ron, \'93Snape\'92s always taking points \
off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid \
with you?\'94 \
\
At five to three they left the castle and made their way \
across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden \
house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow \
and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door. \
\
When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling \
from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid \'92s \
voice rang out, saying, \'93Back, Fang \'97 back.\'94 \
\
Hagrid \'92s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he \
pulled the door open. \
\
\'93Hang on,\'94 he said. \'93Back, Fang.\'94 \
\
He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar \
of an enormous black boarhound. \
\
There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants \
were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was \
\
Page | 156 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a \
massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it. \
\
\'93Make yerselves at home,\'94 said Hagrid, letting go of \
Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started \
licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as \
fierce as he looked. \
\
\'93This is Ron,\'94 Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring \
boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock \
cakes onto a plate. \
\
\'93Another Weasley, eh?\'94 said Hagrid, glancing at Ron\'92s \
freckles. \'93I spent half me life chasin\'92 yer twin brothers \
away from the forest.\'94 \
\
The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins \
that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron \
pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all \
about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on \
Harry\'92s knee and drooled all over his robes. \
\
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call \
Filch \'93that old git.\'94 \
\
\'93An\'92 as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I\'92d like ter introduce \
her to Fang sometime. D\'92yeh know, every time I go up \
ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can\'92t get \
rid of her \'97 Filch puts her up to it.\'94 \
\
Harry told Hagrid about Snape\'92s lesson. Hagrid, like \
Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape \
liked hardly any of the students. \
\
\'93But he seemed to really hate me.\'94 \
\
\'93Rubbish!\'94 said Hagrid. \'93Why should he?\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 157 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Yet Harry couldn\'92t help thinking that Hagrid didn\'92t \
quite meet his eyes when he said that. \
\
\'93How\'92s yer brother Charlie?\'94 Hagrid asked Ron. \'93I \
liked him a lot \'97 great with animals.\'94 \
\
Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on \
purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie\'92s \
work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper \
that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was \
a cutting from the Daily Prophet : \
\
GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST \
\
Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts \
on 3 1 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark \
wizards or witches unknown. \
\
Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had \
been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact \
been emptied the same day. \
\
\'93But we\'92re not telling you what was in there, so keep \
your noses out if you know what\'92s good for you,\'94 said \
a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon. \
\
Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that \
someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn\'92t \
mentioned the date. \
\
\'93Hagrid!\'94 said Harry, \'93that Gringotts break-in \
happened on my birthday! It might\'92ve been happening \
while we were there!\'94 \
\
There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn\'92t \
meet Harry\'92s eyes this time. He grunted and offered \
him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. \
\
The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied \
earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven \
Page | 158 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, \
taking out that grubby little package. Had that been \
what the thieves were looking for? \
\
As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for \
dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes \
they\'92d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that \
none of the lessons he\'92d had so far had given him as \
much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid \
collected that package just in time? Where was it \
now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape \
that he didn\'92t want to tell Harry? \

THE MIDNIGHT DUEL \
\
Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he \
hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met \
Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had \
Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn\'92t have to put \
up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn\'92t until \
they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor \
common room that made them all groan. Flying \
lessons would be starting on Thursday \'97 and \
Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together. \
\
\'93Typical,\'94 said Harry darkly. \'93Just what I always \
wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in \
front of Malfoy.\'94 \
\
He had been looking forward to learning to fly more \
than anything else. \
\
\'93You don\'92t know that you\'92ll make a fool of yourself,\'94 \
said Ron reasonably. \'93Anyway, I know Malfoy\'92s always \
going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet \
that\'92s all talk.\'94 \
\
Page | 160 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He \
complained loudly about first years never getting on \
the House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful \
stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly \
escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn\'92t the only \
one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he\'92d \
spent most of his childhood zooming around the \
countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell \
anyone who\'92d listen about the time he\'92d almost hit a \
hang glider on Charlie\'92s old broom. Everyone from \
wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. \
Ron had already had a big argument with Dean \
Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. \
Ron couldn\'92t see what was exciting about a game with \
only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry \
had caught Ron prodding Dean\'92s poster of West Ham \
soccer team, trying to make the players move. \
\
Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, \
because his grandmother had never let him near one. \
Privately, Harry felt she\'92d had good reason, because \
Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of \
accidents even with both feet on the ground. \
\
Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about \
flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn\'92t \
learn by heart out of a book \'97 not that she hadn\'92t \
tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all \
stupid with flying tips she\'92d gotten out of a library \
book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was \
hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything \
that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, \
but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione \'92s \
lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail. \
\
Harry hadn\'92t had a single letter since Hagrid\'92s note, \
something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of \
course. Malfoy \'92s eagle owl was always bringing him \
\
\
\
Page | 161 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
packages of sweets from home, which he opened \
gloatingly at the Slytherin table. \
\
A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his \
grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed \
them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which \
seemed to be full of white smoke. \
\
\'93It\'92s a Remembrall!\'94 he explained. \'93Gran knows I \
forget things \'97 this tells you if there\'92s something \
you\'92ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this \
and if it turns red \'97 oh ...\'94 His face fell, because the \
Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, \'93... you\'92ve \
forgotten something ...\'94 \
\
Neville was trying to remember what he\'92d forgotten \
when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor \
table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand. \
\
Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half \
hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor \
McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any \
teacher in the school, was there in a flash. \
\
\'93What\'92s going on?\'94 \
\
\'93Malfoy\'92s got my Remembrall, Professor.\'94 \
\
Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall \
back on the table. \
\
\'93Just looking,\'94 he said, and he sloped away with \
Crabbe and Goyle behind him. \
\
At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the \
other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto \
the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, \
breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as \
they marched down the sloping lawns toward a \
Page | 162 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds \
to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying \
darkly in the distance. \
\
The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty \
broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry \
had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about \
the school brooms, saying that some of them started \
to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly \
to the left. \
\
Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, \
gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk. \
\
\'93Well, what are you all waiting for?\'94 she barked. \
\'93Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry \
up.\'94 " \
\
Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and \
some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles. \
\
\'93Stick out your right hand over your broom,\'94 called \
Madam Hooch at the front, \'93and say \'91Up!\'92 \'94 \
\
\'93UP!\'94 everyone shouted. \
\
Harry\'92s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it \
was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger\'92s had \
simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville\'92s hadn\'92t \
moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell \
when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a \
quaver in Neville\'92s voice that said only too clearly that \
he wanted to keep his feet on the ground. \
\
Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their \
brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up \
and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and \
Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he\'92d been \
doing it wrong for years. \
\
Page | 163 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the \
ground, hard,\'94 said Madam Hooch. \'93Keep your \
brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight \
back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle \
\'97 three \'97 two \'97 \'94 \
\
But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of \
being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the \
whistle had touched Madam Hooch\'92s lips. \
\
\'93Come back, boy!\'94 she shouted, but Neville was rising \
straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle \'97 twelve \
feet \'97 twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face \
look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, \
slip sideways off the broom and \'97 \
\
WHAM \'97 a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay \
facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was \
still rising higher and higher, and started to drift \
lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight. \
\
Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as \
white as his. \
\
\'93Broken wrist,\'94 Harry heard her mutter. \'93Come on, \
boy \'97 it\'92s all right, up you get.\'94 \
\
She turned to the rest of the class. \
\
\'93None of you is to move while I take this boy to the \
hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are \
or you\'92ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say \
\'91Quidditch.\'92 Come on, dear.\'94 \
\
Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, \
hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm \
around him. \
\
\
\

\
\
\
\
No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst \
into laughter. \
\
\'93Did you see his face, the great lump?\'94 \
\
The other Slytherins joined in. \
\
\'93Shut up, Malfoy,\'94 snapped Parvati Patil. \
\
\'93Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?\'94 said Pansy \
Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. \'93Never thought \
you\'92d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.\'94 \
\
\'93Look!\'94 said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching \
something out of the grass. \'93It\'92s that stupid thing \
Longbottom\'92s gran sent him.\'94 \
\
The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up. \
\
\'93Give that here, Malfoy,\'94 said Harry quietly. Everyone \
stopped talking to watch. \
\
Malfoy smiled nastily. \
\
\'93I think I\'92ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find \
\'97 how about \'97 up a tree?\'94 \
\
\'93Give it here!\'94 Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto \
his broomstick and taken off. He hadn\'92t been lying, he \
could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost \
branches of an oak he called, \'93Come and get it, \
Potter!\'94 \
\
Harry grabbed his broom. \
\
\'93iVo!\'94 shouted Hermione Granger. \'93Madam Hooch told \
us not to move \'97 you\'92ll get us all into trouble.\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 165 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. \
\
He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the \
ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his \
hair, and his robes whipped out behind him \'97 and in \
a rush of fierce joy he realized he\'92d found something \
he could do without being taught \'97 this was easy, \
this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a \
little to take it even higher, and heard screams and \
gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring \
whoop from Ron. \
\
He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in \
midair. Malfoy looked stunned. \
\
\'93Give it here,\'94 Harry called, \'93or I\'92ll knock you off that \
broom!\'94 \
\
\'93Oh, yeah?\'94 said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking \
worried. \
\
Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward \
and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it \
shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got \
out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about- \
face and held the broom steady. A few people below \
were clapping. \
\
\'93No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, \
Malfoy,\'94 Harry called. \
\
The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy. \
\
\'93Catch it if you can, then!\'94 he shouted, and he threw \
the glass ball high into the air and streaked back \
toward the ground. \
\
Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up \
in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward \
and pointed his broom handle down \'97 next second \
\
Page | 166 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball \
\'97 wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the \
screams of people watching \'97 he stretched out his \
hand \'97 a foot from the ground he caught it, just in \
time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently \
onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in \
his fist. \
\
\'93HARRY POTTER!\'94 \
\
His heart sank faster than he\'92d just dived. Professor \
McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his \
feet, trembling. \
\
\'93Never \'97 in all my time at Hogwarts \'97 \'94 \
\
Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with \
shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, \'93 \'97 how dare \
you \'97 might have broken your neck \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93It wasn\'92t his fault, Professor \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Be quiet, Miss Patil \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93But Malfoy \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93That\'92s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.\'94 \
\
Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle\'92s \
triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in \
Professor McGonagall\'92s wake as she strode toward the \
castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. \
\
He wanted to say something to defend himself, but \
there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. \
Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without \
even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now \
he\'92d done it. He hadn\'92t even lasted two weeks. He\'92d be \
packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the \
Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep? \
Page | 167 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, \
and still Professor McGonagall didn\'92t say a word to \
him. She wrenched open doors and marched along \
corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. \
Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He \
thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as \
gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid\'92s assistant. \
His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron \
and the others becoming wizards while he stumped \
around the grounds carrying Hagrid\'92s bag. \
\
Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. \
She opened the door and poked her head inside. \
\
\'93Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood \
for a moment?\'94 \
\
Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane \
she was going to use on him? \
\
But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year \
boy who came out of Flitwick\'92s class looking \
confused. \
\
\'93Follow me, you two,\'94 said Professor McGonagall, and \
they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking \
curiously at Harry. \
\
\'93In here.\'94 \
\
Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom \
that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy \
writing rude words on the blackboard. \
\
\'93Out, Peeves!\'94 she barked. Peeves threw the chalk \
into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out \
cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door \
behind him and turned to face the two boys. \
\
\
\
Page | 168 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood \'97 I\'92ve found you a \
Seeker.\'94 \
\
Wood\'92s expression changed from puzzlement to \
delight. \
\
\'93Are you serious, Professor?\'94 \
\
\'93Absolutely,\'94 said Professor McGonagall crisply. \'93The \
boy\'92s a natural. I\'92ve never seen anything like it. Was \
that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?\'94 \
\
Harry nodded silently. He didn\'92t have a clue what was \
going on, but he didn\'92t seem to be being expelled, and \
some of the feeling started coming back to his legs. \
\
\'93He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot \
dive,\'94 Professor McGonagall told Wood. \'93Didn\'92t even \
scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn\'92t have done \
it.\'94 \
\
Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had \
come true at once. \
\
\'93Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?\'94 he asked \
excitedly. \
\
\'93Wood\'92s captain of the Gryffindor team,\'94 Professor \
McGonagall explained. \
\
\'93He\'92s just the build for a Seeker, too,\'94 said Wood, now \
walking around Harry and staring at him. \'93Light \'97 \
speedy \'97 we\'92ll have to get him a decent broom, \
Professor \'97 a Nimbus Two Thousand or a \
Cleansweep Seven, I\'92d say.\'94 \
\
\'93I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we \
can\'92t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need \
a better team than last year. Flattened in that last \
\

\
\
\
\
match by Slytherin, I couldn\'92t look Severus Snape in \
the face for weeks. ...\'94 \
\
Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses \
at Harry. \
\
\'93I want to hear you\'92re training hard, Potter, or I may \
change my mind about punishing you.\'94 \
\
Then she suddenly smiled. \
\
\'93Your father would have been proud,\'94 she said. \'93He \
was an excellent Quidditch player himself.\'94 \
\
\'93You\'92re joking.\'94 \
\
It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron \
what had happened when he\'92d left the grounds with \
Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and \
kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he\'92d forgotten all \
about it. \
\
\'93Seeker?\'94 he said. \'93But first years never \'97 you must \
be the youngest House player in about \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93 \'97 a century,\'94 said Harry, shoveling pie into his \
mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the \
excitement of the afternoon. \'93Wood told me.\'94 \
\
Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and \
gaped at Harry. \
\
\'93I start training next week,\'94 said Harry. \'93Only don\'92t \
tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.\'94 \
\
Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, \
spotted Harry, and hurried over. \
\
\
\
Page | 170 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Well done,\'94 said George in a low voice. \'93Wood told us. \
We\'92re on the team too \'97 Beaters.\'94 \
\
\'93I tell you, we\'92re going to win that Quidditch Cup for \
sure this year,\'94 said Fred. \'93We haven\'92t won since \
Charlie left, but this year\'92s team is going to be \
brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost \
skipping when he told us.\'94 \
\
\'93Anyway, we\'92ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he\'92s \
found a new secret passageway out of the school.\'94 \
\
\'93Bet it\'92s that one behind the statue of Gregory the \
Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.\'94 \
\
Fred and George had hardly disappeared when \
someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked \
by Crabbe and Goyle. \
\
\'93Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the \
train back to the Muggles?\'94 \
\
\'93You\'92re a lot braver now that you\'92re back on the \
ground and you\'92ve got your little friends with you,\'94 \
said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all \
little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table \
was full of teachers, neither of them could do more \
than crack their knuckles and scowl. \
\
\'93I\'92d take you on anytime on my own,\'94 said Malfoy. \
\'93Tonight, if you want. Wizard\'92s duel. Wands only \'97 \
no contact. What\'92s the matter? Never heard of a \
wizard\'92s duel before, I suppose?\'94 \
\
\'93Of course he has,\'94 said Ron, wheeling around. \'93I\'92m \
his second, who\'92s yours?\'94 \
\
Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up. \
\
\
\
Page | 171 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Crabbe,\'94 he said. \'93Midnight all right? Well meet you \
in the trophy room; that\'92s always unlocked.\'94 \
\
When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each \
other. \
\
\'93What is a wizard\'92s duel?\'94 said Harry. \'93And what do \
you mean, you\'92re my second?\'94 \
\
\'93Well, a second\'92s there to take over if you die,\'94 said \
Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. \
Catching the look on Harry\'92s face, he added quickly, \
\'93But people only die in proper duels, you know, with \
real wizards. The most you and Malfoy\'92ll be able to do \
is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows \
enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he \
expected you to refuse, anyway.\'94 \
\
\'93And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?\'94 \
\
\'93Throw it away and punch him on the nose,\'94 Ron \
suggested. \
\
\'93Excuse me.\'94 \
\
They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger. \
\
\'93Can\'92t a person eat in peace in this place?\'94 said Ron. \
\
Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry. \
\
\'93I couldn\'92t help overhearing what you and Malfoy \
were saying \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Bet you could,\'94 Ron muttered. \
\
\'93 \'97 and you mustn\'92t go wandering around the school \
at night, think of the points you\'92ll lose Gryffindor if \
\
\
\
Page | 172 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
you\'92re caught, and you\'92re bound to be. It\'92s really very \
selfish of you.\'94 \
\
\'93And it\'92s really none of your business,\'94 said Harry. \
\'93Good-bye,\'94 said Ron. \
\
All the same, it wasn\'92t what you\'92d call the perfect end \
to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later \
listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville \
wasn\'92t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent \
all evening giving him advice such as \'93If he tries to \
curse you, you\'92d better dodge it, because I can\'92t \
remember how to block them.\'94 There was a very good \
chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. \
Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, \
breaking another school rule today. On the other \
hand, Malfoy\'92s sneering face kept looming up out of \
the darkness \'97 this was his big chance to beat \
Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn\'92t miss it. \
\
\'93Half-past eleven,\'94 Ron muttered at last, \'93we\'92d better \
go.\'94 \
\
They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their \
wands, and crept across the tower room, down the \
spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common \
room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, \
turning all the armchairs into hunched black \
shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole \
when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, \'93I \
can\'92t believe you\'92re going to do this, Harry.\'94 \
\
A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, \
wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown. \
\
\'93You!\'94 said Ron furiously. \'93Go back to bed!\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 173 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93I almost told your brother,\'94 Hermione snapped, \
\
\'93Percy \'97 he\'92s a prefect, he\'92d put a stop to this.\'94 \
\
Harry couldn\'92t believe anyone could be so interfering. \
\
\'93Come on,\'94 he said to Ron. He pushed open the \
portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole. \
\
Hermione wasn\'92t going to give up that easily. She \
followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at \
them like an angry goose. \
\
\'93Don\'92t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care \
about yourselves, / don\'92t want Slytherin to win the \
House Cup, and you\'92ll lose all the points I got from \
Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching \
Spells.\'94 \
\
\'93Go away.\'94 \
\
\'93All right, but I warned you, you just remember what \
I said when you\'92re on the train home tomorrow, \
you\'92re so \'97 \'94 \
\
But what they were, they didn\'92t find out. Hermione \
had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back \
inside and found herself facing an empty painting. \
\
The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and \
Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower. \
\
\'93Now what am I going to do?\'94 she asked shrilly. \
\
\'93That\'92s your problem,\'94 said Ron. \'93We\'92ve got to go, \
we\'92re going to be late.\'94 \
\
They hadn\'92t even reached the end of the corridor \
when Hermione caught up with them. \
\
\'93I\'92m coming with you,\'94 she said. \
\
Page | 174 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93You are not.\'94 \
\
\
\
\'93D\'92you think I\'92m going to stand out here and wait for \
Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I\'92ll tell \
him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you \
can back me up.\'94 \
\
\'93You\'92ve got some nerve \'97 \'94 said Ron loudly. \
\
\'93Shut up, both of you!\'94 said Harry sharply. \'93I heard \
something.\'94 \
\
It was a sort of snuffling. \
\
\'93Mrs. Norris?\'94 breathed Ron, squinting through the \
dark. \
\
It wasn\'92t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up \
on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake \
as they crept nearer. \
\
\'93Thank goodness you found me! I\'92ve been out here for \
hours, I couldn\'92t remember the new password to get \
in to bed.\'94 \
\
\'93Keep your voice down, Neville. The password\'92s \'91Pig \
snout\'92 but it won\'92t help you now, the Fat Lady\'92s gone \
off somewhere.\'94 \
\
\'93How\'92s your arm?\'94 said Harry. \
\
\'93Fine,\'94 said Neville, showing them. \'93Madam Pomfrey \
mended it in about a minute.\'94 \
\
\'93Good \'97 well, look, Neville, we\'92ve got to be \
somewhere, we\'92ll see you later \'97 \'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 175 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Don\'92t leave me!\'94 said Neville, scrambling to his feet, \
\
\'93I don\'92t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron\'92s \
been past twice already.\'94 \
\
Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at \
Hermione and Neville. \
\
\'93If either of you get us caught, I\'92ll never rest until I\'92ve \
learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us \
about, and used it on you.\'94 \
\
Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron \
exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry \
hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all \
forward. \
\
They flitted along corridors striped with bars of \
moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry \
expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they \
were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor \
and tiptoed toward the trophy room. \
\
Malfoy and Crabbe weren\'92t there yet. The crystal \
trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught \
them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver \
and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, \
keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the \
room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in \
and started at once. The minutes crept by. \
\
\'93He\'92s late, maybe he\'92s chickened out,\'94 Ron whispered. \
\
Then a noise in the next room made them jump. \
\
Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard \
someone speak \'97 and it wasn\'92t Malfoy. \
\
\'93Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a \
corner.\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 176 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, \
Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as \
quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the \
door, away from Filch\'92s voice. Neville\'92s robes had \
barely whipped round the corner when they heard \
Filch enter the trophy room. \
\
\'93They\'92re in here somewhere,\'94 they heard him mutter, \
\'93probably hiding.\'94 \
\
\'93This way!\'94 Harry mouthed to the others and, \
petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full \
of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting \
nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak \
and broke into a run \'97 he tripped, grabbed Ron \
around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right \
into a suit of armor. \
\
The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the \
whole castle. \
\
\'93RUN!\'94 Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted \
down the gallery, not looking back to see whether \
Filch was following \'97 they swung around the \
doorpost and galloped down one corridor then \
another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where \
they were or where they were going \'97 they ripped \
through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden \
passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their \
Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from \
the trophy room. \
\
\'93I think we\'92ve lost him,\'94 Harry panted, leaning against \
the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was \
bent double, wheezing and spluttering. \
\
\'93I \'97 told \'97 you,\'94 Hermione gasped, clutching at the \
stitch in her chest, \'93I \'97 told \'97 you.\'94 \
\
\

\
\
\
\
\'93We\'92ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,\'94 said Ron, \
\'93quickly as possible.\'94 \
\
\'93Malfoy tricked you,\'94 Hermione said to Harry. \'93You \
realize that, don\'92t you? He was never going to meet \
you \'97 Filch knew someone was going to be in the \
trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.\'94 \
\
Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn\'92t \
going to tell her that. \
\
\'93Let\'92s go.\'94 \
\
It wasn\'92t going to be that simple. They hadn\'92t gone \
more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled \
and something came shooting out of a classroom in \
front of them. \
\
It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a \
squeal of delight. \
\
\'93Shut up, Peeves \'97 please \'97 you\'92ll get us thrown \
out.\'94 \
\
Peeves cackled. \
\
\'93Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, \
tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you\'92ll get caughty.\'94 \
\
\'93Not if you don\'92t give us away, Peeves, please.\'94 \
\
\'93Should tell Filch, I should,\'94 said Peeves in a sanity \
voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. \'93It\'92s for your \
own good, you know.\'94 \
\
\'93Get out of the way,\'94 snapped Ron, taking a swipe at \
Peeves \'97 this was a big mistake. \
\
\
\
Page | 178 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93STUDENTS OUT OF BED!\'94 Peeves bellowed, \
\'93STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS \
CORRIDOR!\'94 \
\
Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right \
to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a \
door \'97 and it was locked. \
\
\'93This is it!\'94 Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at \
the door, \'93We\'92re done for! This is the end!\'94 \
\
They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he \
could toward Peeves \'92s shouts. \
\
\'93Oh, move over,\'94 Hermione snarled. She grabbed \
Harry\'92s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, \
\'93Alohomora\\\'94 \
\
The lock clicked and the door swung open \'97 they \
piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their \
ears against it, listening. \
\
\'93Which way did they go, Peeves?\'94 Filch was saying. \
\'93Quick, tell me.\'94 \
\
\'93Say \'91please.\'92 \'94 \
\
\'93Don\'92t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\'94 \
\
\'93Shan\'92t say nothing if you don\'92t say please,\'94 said \
Peeves in his annoying singsong voice. \
\
\'93All right \'97 please.\'94 \
\
\'93NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn\'92t say nothing \
if you didn\'92t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\'94 And they \
heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch \
cursing in rage. \
\
\
\
Page | 179 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93He thinks this door is locked,\'94 Harry whispered. \'93I \
think well be okay \'97 get off Neville!\'94 For Neville had \
been tugging on the sleeve of Harry\'92s bathrobe for the \
last minute. \'93What?\'94 \
\
Harry turned around \'97 and saw, quite clearly, what. \
For a moment, he was sure he\'92d walked into a \
nightmare \'97 this was too much, on top of everything \
that had happened so far. \
\
They weren\'92t in a room, as he had supposed. They \
were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third \
floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden. \
\
They were looking straight into the eyes of a \
monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space \
between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three \
pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and \
quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, \
saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs. \
\
It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, \
and Harry knew that the only reason they weren\'92t \
already dead was that their sudden appearance had \
taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over \
that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous \
growls meant. \
\
Harry groped for the doorknob \'97 between Filch and \
death, he\'92d take Filch. \
\
They fell backward \'97 Harry slammed the door shut, \
and they ran, they almost flew, back down the \
corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them \
somewhere else, because they didn\'92t see him \
anywhere, but they hardly cared \'97 all they wanted to \
do was put as much space as possible between them \
and that monster. They didn\'92t stop running until they \
\
\
\
Page | 180 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh \
floor. \
\
\'93Where on earth have you all been?\'94 she asked, \
looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders \
and their flushed, sweaty faces. \
\
\'93Never mind that \'97 pig snout, pig snout,\'94 panted \
Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They \
scrambled into the common room and collapsed, \
trembling, into armchairs. \
\
It was a while before any of them said anything. \
Neville, indeed, looked as if he\'92d never speak again. \
\
\'93What do they think they\'92re doing, keeping a thing \
like that locked up in a school?\'94 said Ron finally. \'93If \
any dog needs exercise, that one does.\'94 \
\
Hermione had got both her breath and her bad \
temper back again. \
\
\'93You don\'92t use your eyes, any of you, do you?\'94 she \
snapped. \'93Didn\'92t you see what it was standing on?\'94 \
\
\'93The floor?\'94 Harry suggested. \'93I wasn\'92t looking at its \
feet, I was too busy with its heads.\'94 \
\
\'93No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It\'92s \
obviously guarding something.\'94 \
\
She stood up, glaring at them. \
\
\'93I hope you\'92re pleased with yourselves. We could all \
have been killed \'97 or worse, expelled. Now, if you \
don\'92t mind, I\'92m going to bed.\'94 \
\
Ron stared after her, his mouth open. \
\
\
\
Page | 181 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93No, we don\'92t mind,\'94 he said. \'93You\'92d think we dragged \
her along, wouldn\'92t you?\'94 \
\
But Hermione had given Harry something else to \
think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was \
guarding something. . . . What had Hagrid said? \
Gringotts was the safest place in the world for \
something you wanted to hide \'97 except perhaps \
Hogwarts. \
\
It looked as though Harry had found out where the \
grubby little package from vault seven hundred and \
thirteen was. \

\
HALLOWEEN \
\
Malfoy couldn\'92t believe his eyes when he saw that \
Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, \
looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the \
next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting \
the three-headed dog had been an excellent \
adventure, and they were quite keen to have another \
one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the \
package that seemed to have been moved from \
Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time \
wondering what could possibly need such heavy \
protection. \
\
\'93It\'92s either really valuable or really dangerous,\'94 said \
Ron. \
\
\'93Or both,\'94 said Harry. \
\
But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious \
object was that it was about two inches long, they \
didn\'92t have much chance of guessing what it was \
without further clues. \
\
Page | 183 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone -J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest \
interest in what lay underneath the dog and the \
trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near \
the dog again. \
\
Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and \
Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they \
saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted \
now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their \
great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail \
about a week later. \
\
As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, \
everyone\'92s attention was caught at once by a long, \
thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry \
was just as interested as everyone else to see what \
was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the \
owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, \
knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly \
fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a \
letter on top of the parcel. \
\
Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, \
because it said: \
\
\
\
DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE. \
\
It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I \
don\'92t want everybody knowing you\'92ve got a \
broomstick or they\'92ll all want one. Oliver Wood will \
meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven \
o\'92clock for your first training session. \
\
Professor M. McGonagall \
\
Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the \
note to Ron to read. \
\
Page | 184 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93A Nimbus Two Thousand!\'94 Ron moaned enviously. \
\'93I\'92ve never even touched one.\'94 \
\
They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the \
broomstick in private before their first class, but \
halfway across the entrance hall they found the way \
upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized \
the package from Harry and felt it. \
\
\'93That\'92s a broomstick,\'94 he said, throwing it back to \
Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. \
\'93You\'92ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren\'92t \
allowed them.\'94 \
\
Ron couldn\'92t resist it. \
\
\'93It\'92s not any old broomstick,\'94 he said, \'93it\'92s a Nimbus \
Two Thousand. What did you say you\'92ve got at home, \
Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\'94 Ron grinned at Harry. \
\'93Comets look flashy, but they\'92re not in the same \
league as the Nimbus.\'94 \
\
\'93What would you know about it, Weasley, you \
couldn\'92t afford half the handle,\'94 Malfoy snapped back. \
\'93I suppose you and your brothers have to save up \
twig by twig.\'94 \
\
Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared \
at Malfoy\'92s elbow. \
\
\'93Not arguing, I hope, boys?\'94 he squeaked. \
\
\'93Potters been sent a broomstick, Professor,\'94 said \
Malfoy quickly. \
\
\'93Yes, yes, that\'92s right,\'94 said Professor Flitwick, \
beaming at Harry. \'93Professor McGonagall told me all \
about the special circumstances, Potter. And what \
model is it?\'94 \
\
Page | 185 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,\'94 said Harry, fighting \
not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy\'92s face. \
\'93And it\'92s really thanks to Malfoy here that I\'92ve got it,\'94 \
he added. \
\
Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their \
laughter at Malfoy\'92s obvious rage and confusion. \
\
\'93Well, it\'92s true,\'94 Harry chortled as they reached the \
top of the marble staircase, \'93If he hadn\'92t stolen \
Neville\'92s Remembrall I wouldn\'92t be on the team. ...\'94 \
\
\'93So I suppose you think that\'92s a reward for breaking \
rules?\'94 came an angry voice from just behind them. \
Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking \
disapprovingly at the package in Harry\'92s hand. \
\
\'93I thought you weren\'92t speaking to us?\'94 said Harry. \
\
\'93Yes, don\'92t stop now,\'94 said Ron, \'93it\'92s doing us so \
much good.\'94 \
\
Hermione marched away with her nose in the air. \
\
Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his \
lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the \
dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under \
his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where \
he\'92d be learning to play that night. He bolted his \
dinner that evening without noticing what he was \
eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap \
the Nimbus Two Thousand at last. \
\
\'93Wow,\'94 Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto \
Harry\'92s bedspread. \
\
Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different \
brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and \
shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of \
\
Page | 186 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand \
written in gold near the top. \
\
As seven o\'92clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and \
set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He\'92d \
never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of \
seats were raised in stands around the field so that \
the spectators were high enough to see what was \
going on. At either end of the field were three golden \
poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of \
the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles \
through, except that they were fifty feet high. \
\
Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry \
mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the \
ground. What a feeling \'97 he swooped in and out of \
the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. \
The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he \
wanted at his lightest touch. \
\
\'93Hey, Potter, come down!\'94 \
\
Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large \
wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to \
him. \
\
\'93Very nice,\'94 said Wood, his eyes glinting. \'93I see what \
McGonagall meant ... you really are a natural. I\'92m \
just going to teach you the rules this evening, then \
you\'92ll be joining team practice three times a week.\'94 \
\
He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized \
balls. \
\
\'93Right,\'94 said Wood. \'93Now, Quidditch is easy enough to \
understand, even if it\'92s not too easy to play. There are \
seven players on each side. Three of them are called \
Chasers.\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 187 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Three Chasers,\'94 Harry repeated, as Wood took out a \
bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball. \
\
\'93This ball\'92s called the Quaffle,\'94 said Wood. \'93The \
Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and \
get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten \
points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the \
hoops. Follow me?\'94 \
\
\'93The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through \
the hoops to score,\'94 Harry recited. \'93So \'97 that\'92s sort of \
like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn\'92t \
it?\'94 \
\
\
\
\'93What\'92s basketball?\'94 said Wood curiously. \
\
\'93Never mind,\'94 said Harry quickly. \
\
\'93Now, there\'92s another player on each side who\'92s called \
the Keeper \'97 I\'92m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly \
around our hoops and stop the other team from \
scoring.\'94 \
\
\'93Three Chasers, one Keeper,\'94 said Harry, who was \
determined to remember it all. \'93And they play with \
the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?\'94 He \
pointed at the three balls left inside the box. \
\
\'93I\'92ll show you now,\'94 said Wood. \'93Take this.\'94 \
\
He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short \
baseball bat. \
\
\'93I\'92m going to show you what the Bludgers do,\'94 Wood \
said. \'93These two are the Bludgers.\'94 \
\
He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and \
slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed \
\
\
\
Page | 188 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps \
holding them inside the box. \
\
\'93Stand back,\'94 Wood warned Harry. He bent down and \
freed one of the Bludgers. \
\
At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then \
pelted straight at Harry\'92s face. Harry swung at it with \
the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it \
zigzagging away into the air \'97 it zoomed around their \
heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it \
and managed to pin it to the ground. \
\
\'93See?\'94 Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger \
back into the crate and strapping it down safely. \'93The \
Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off \
their brooms. That\'92s why you have two Beaters on \
each team \'97 the Weasley twins are ours \'97 it\'92s their \
job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and \
knock them toward the other team. So \'97 think you\'92ve \
got all that?\'94 \
\
\'93Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the \
Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the \
Bludgers away from their team,\'94 Harry reeled off. \
\
\'93Very good,\'94 said Wood. \
\
\'93Er \'97 have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\'94 Harry \
asked, hoping he sounded offhand. \
\
\'93Never at Hogwarts. We\'92ve had a couple of broken \
jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last \
member of the team is the Seeker. That\'92s you. And \
you don\'92t have to worry about the Quaffle or the \
Bludgers \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93 \'97 unless they crack my head open.\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 189 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Don\'92t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for \
the Bludgers \'97 I mean, they\'92re like a pair of human \
Bludgers themselves.\'94 \
\
Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth \
and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the \
Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. \
It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver \
wings. \
\
\'93This,\'94 said Wood, \'93is the Golden Snitch, and it\'92s the \
most important ball of the lot. It\'92s very hard to catch \
because it\'92s so fast and difficult to see. It\'92s the \
Seeker\'92s job to catch it. You\'92ve got to weave in and out \
of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get \
it before the other team\'92s Seeker, because whichever \
Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra \
hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. \
That\'92s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of \
Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it \
can go on for ages \'97 I think the record is three \
months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so \
the players could get some sleep. \
\
\'93Well, that\'92s it \'97 any questions?\'94 \
\
Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to \
do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the \
problem. \
\
\'93We won\'92t practice with the Snitch yet,\'94 said Wood, \
carefully shutting it back inside the crate, \'93it\'92s too \
dark, we might lose it. Let\'92s try you out with a few of \
these.\'94 \
\
He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket \
and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the \
air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could \
in every direction for Harry to catch. \
\
Page | 190 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Harry didn\'92t miss a single one, and Wood was \
delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen \
and they couldn\'92t carry on. \
\
\'93That Quidditch Cup\'92ll have our name on it this year,\'94 \
said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the \
castle. \'93I wouldn\'92t be surprised if you turn out better \
than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for \
England if he hadn\'92t gone off chasing dragons.\'94 \
\
Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what \
with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top \
of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it \
when he realized that he\'92d already been at Hogwarts \
two months. The castle felt more like home than \
Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming \
more and more interesting now that they had \
mastered the basics. \
\
On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious \
smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the \
corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced \
in Charms that he thought they were ready to start \
making objects fly, something they had all been dying \
to try since they\'92d seen him make Neville\'92s toad zoom \
around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the \
class into pairs to practice. Harry\'92s partner was \
Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville \
had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was \
to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to \
tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. \
She hadn\'92t spoken to either of them since the day \
Harry\'92s broomstick had arrived. \
\
\'93Now, don\'92t forget that nice wrist movement we\'92ve \
been practicing!\'94 squeaked Professor Flitwick, \
perched on top of his pile of books as usual. \'93Swish \
and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the \
magic words properly is very important, too \'97 never \
Page | 191 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
forget Wizard Baruffio, who said \'91s\'92 instead of \'91f and \
found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his \
chest.\'94 \
\
It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and \
flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be \
sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got \
so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set \
fire to it \'97 Harry had to put it out with his hat. \
\
Ron, at the next table, wasn\'92t having much more \
luck. \
\
\'93Wingardium Leviosal\'94 he shouted, waving his long \
arms like a windmill. \
\
\'93You\'92re saying it wrong,\'94 Harry heard Hermione snap. \
\'93It\'92s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the \'91gar\'92 nice and \
long.\'94 \
\
\'93You do it, then, if you\'92re so clever,\'94 Ron snarled. \
\
Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked \
her wand, and said, \'93Wingardium LeviosaV\'92 \
\
Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four \
feet above their heads. \
\
\'93Oh, well done!\'94 cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \
\'93Everyone see here, Miss Granger\'92s done it!\'94 \
\
Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. \
\
\'93It\'92s no wonder no one can stand her,\'94 he said to \
Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded \
corridor, \'93she\'92s a nightmare, honestly.\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 192 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past \
him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her \
face \'97 and was startled to see that she was in tears. \
\
\'93I think she heard you.\'94 \
\
\'93So?\'94 said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \
\'93She must\'92ve noticed she\'92s got no friends.\'94 \
\
Hermione didn\'92t turn up for the next class and wasn\'92t \
seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great \
Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard \
Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione \
was crying in the girls\'92 bathroom and wanted to be \
left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but \
a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, \
where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of \
their minds. \
\
A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and \
ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the \
tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the \
pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on \
the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term \
banquet. \
\
Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato \
when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, \
his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone \
stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore\'92s chair, \
slumped against the table, and gasped, \'93Troll \'97 in \
the dungeons \'97 thought you ought to know.\'94 \
\
He then sank to the floor in a dead faint. \
\
There was an uproar. It took several purple \
firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor \
Dumbledore\'92s wand to bring silence. \
\

\
\'93Prefects,\'94 he rumbled, \'93lead your Houses back to the \
dormitories immediately!\'94 \
\
Percy was in his element. \
\
\'93Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear \
the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind \
me, now. Make way, first years coming through! \
Excuse me, I\'92m a prefect!\'94 \
\
\'93How could a troll get in?\'94 Harry asked as they \
climbed the stairs. \
\
\'93Don\'92t ask me, they\'92re supposed to be really stupid,\'94 \
said Ron. \'93Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween \
joke.\'94 \
\
They passed different groups of people hurrying in \
different directions. As they jostled their way through \
a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly \
grabbed Ron\'92s arm. \
\
\'93I\'92ve just thought \'97 Hermione.\'94 \
\
\'93What about her?\'94 \
\
\'93She doesn\'92t know about the troll.\'94 \
\
Ron bit his lip. \
\
\'93Oh, all right,\'94 he snapped. \'93But Percy\'92d better not \
see us.\'94 \
\
Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the \
other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and \
hurried off toward the girls\'92 bathroom. They had just \
turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps \
behind them. \
\
\
\
Page | 194 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Percy!\'94 hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large \
stone griffin. \
\
Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but \
Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from \
view. \
\
\'93What\'92s he doing?\'94 Harry whispered. \'93Why isn\'92t he \
down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?\'94 \
\
\'93Search me.\'94 \
\
Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor \
after Snape \'92s fading footsteps. \
\
\'93He\'92s heading for the third floor,\'94 Harry said, but Ron \
held up his hand. \
\
\'93Can you smell something?\'94 \
\
Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a \
mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no \
one seems to clean. \
\
And then they heard it \'97 a low grunting, and the \
shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed \'97 at \
the end of a passage to the left, something huge was \
moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows \
and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight. \
\
It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a \
dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder \
with its small bald head perched on top like a \
coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with \
flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was \
incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which \
dragged along the floor because its arms were so long. \
\
\
\
Page | 195 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. \
It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then \
slouched slowly into the room. \
\
\'93The key\'92s in the lock,\'94 Harry muttered. \'93We could \
lock it in.\'94 \
\
\'93Good idea,\'94 said Ron nervously. \
\
They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, \
praying the troll wasn\'92t about to come out of it. With \
one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam \
the door, and lock it. \
\
\'93Yes!\'94 \
\
Flushed with their victory, they started to run back \
up the passage, but as they reached the corner they \
heard something that made their hearts stop \'97 a \
high, petrified scream \'97 and it was coming from the \
chamber they\'92d just chained up. \
\
\'93Oh, no,\'94 said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron. \
\
\'93It\'92s the girls\'92 bathroom!\'94 Harry gasped. \
\
\'93 Hermionel\'94 they said together. \
\
It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what \
choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted \
back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their \
panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran \
inside. \
\
Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall \
opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll \
was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the \
walls as it went. \
\
\
\
Page | 196 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Confuse it!\'94 Harry said desperately to Ron, and, \
seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against \
the wall. \
\
The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It \
lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had \
made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It \
hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club \
as it went. \
\
\'93Oy, pea-brain!\'94 yelled Ron from the other side of the \
chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll \
didn\'92t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its \
shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, \
turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving \
Harry time to run around it. \
\
\'93Come on, run, run\\\'94 Harry yelled at Hermione, trying \
to pull her toward the door, but she couldn\'92t move, \
she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open \
with terror. \
\
The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the \
troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, \
who was nearest and had no way to escape. \
\
Harry then did something that was both very brave \
and very stupid: He took a great running jump and \
managed to fasten his arms around the troll\'92s neck \
from behind. The troll couldn\'92t feel Harry hanging \
there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit \
of wood up its nose, and Harry\'92s wand had still been \
in his hand when he\'92d jumped \'97 it had gone straight \
up one of the troll\'92s nostrils. \
\
Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its \
club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, \
the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a \
terrible blow with the club. \
\
Page | 197 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled \
out his own wand \'97 not knowing what he was going \
to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came \
into his head: \'93Wingardium Leviosal\'94 \
\
The club flew suddenly out of the troll\'92s hand, rose \
high, high up into the air, turned slowly over \'97 and \
dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner\'92s \
head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat \
on its face, with a thud that made the whole room \
tremble. \
\
Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of \
breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still \
raised, staring at what he had done. \
\
It was Hermione who spoke first. \
\
\'93Is it \'97 dead?\'94 \
\
\'93I don\'92t think so,\'94 said Harry, \'93I think it\'92s just been \
knocked out.\'94 \
\
He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll\'92s \
nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray \
glue. \
\
\'93Urgh \'97 troll boogers.\'94 \
\
He wiped it on the troll\'92s trousers. \
\
A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the \
three of them look up. They hadn\'92t realized what a \
racket they had been making, but of course, someone \
downstairs must have heard the crashes and the \
troll\'92s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall \
had come bursting into the room, closely followed by \
Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell \
\
\
\

\
\
\
\
took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and \
sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart. \
\
Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was \
looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her \
look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning \
fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry\'92s \
mind. \
\
\'93What on earth were you thinking of?\'94 said Professor \
McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked \
at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the \
air. \'93You\'92re lucky you weren\'92t killed. Why aren\'92t you \
in your dormitory?\'94 \
\
Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked \
at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down. \
\
Then a small voice came out of the shadows. \
\
\'93Please, Professor McGonagall \'97 they were looking for \
me.\'94 \
\
\'93Miss Granger!\'94 \
\
Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last. \
\
\'93I went looking for the troll because I \'97 I thought I \
could deal with it on my own \'97 you know, because \
I\'92ve read all about them.\'94 \
\
Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a \
downright lie to a teacher? \
\
\'93If they hadn\'92t found me, I\'92d be dead now. Harry \
stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out \
with its own club. They didn\'92t have time to come and \
fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they \
arrived.\'94 \
\
Page | 199 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story \
wasn\'92t new to them. \
\
\'93Well \'97 in that case ...\'94 said Professor McGonagall, \
staring at the three of them, \'93Miss Granger, you \
foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a \
mountain troll on your own?\'94 \
\
Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. \
Hermione was the last person to do anything against \
the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to \
get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started \
handing out sweets. \
\
\'93Miss Granger, five points will be taken from \
Gryffindor for this,\'94 said Professor McGonagall. \'93I\'92m \
very disappointed in you. If you\'92re not hurt at all, \
you\'92d better get off to Gryffindor Tower. Students are \
finishing the feast in their Houses.\'94 \
\
Hermione left. \
\
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron. \
\
\'93Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first \
years could have taken on a full-grown mountain \
troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor \
Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.\'94 \
\
They hurried out of the chamber and didn\'92t speak at \
all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief \
to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from \
anything else. \
\
\'93We should have gotten more than ten points,\'94 Ron \
grumbled. \
\
\'93Five, you mean, once she\'92s taken off Hermione \'92s.\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 200 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,\'94 Ron \
admitted. \'93Mind you, we did save her.\'94 \
\
\'93She might not have needed saving if we hadn\'92t \
locked the thing in with her,\'94 Harry reminded him. \
\
They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady. \
\
\'93Pig snout,\'94 they said and entered. \
\
The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone \
was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, \
however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. \
There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of \
them looking at each other, they all said \'93Thanks,\'94 \
and hurried off to get plates. \
\
But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became \
their friend. There are some things you can\'92t share \
without ending up liking each other, and knocking \
out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them. \
\

\
QUIDDITCH \
\
As they entered November, the weather turned very \
cold. The mountains around the school became icy \
gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the \
ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen \
from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on \
the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin \
overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin \
boots. \
\
The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry \
would be playing in his first match after weeks of \
training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor \
won, they would move up into second place in the \
House Championship. \
\
Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood \
had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry \
should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was \
playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry \
didn\'92t know which was worse \'97 people telling him \
he\'92d be brilliant or people telling him they\'92d be \
running around underneath him holding a mattress. \
Page | 202 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a \
friend. He didn\'92t know how he\'92d have gotten through \
all his homework without her, what with all the last- \
minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them \
do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, \
which turned out to be a very interesting read. \
\
Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of \
committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had \
happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that \
Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, \
and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to \
happen to them; that although people rarely died \
playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish \
and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert. \
\
Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about \
breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her \
from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for \
it. The day before Harry\'92s first Quidditch match the \
three of them were out in the freezing courtyard \
during break, and she had conjured them up a bright \
blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. \
They were standing with their backs to it, getting \
warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at \
once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and \
Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from \
view; they were sure it wouldn\'92t be allowed. \
Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces \
caught Snape\'92s eye. He limped over. He hadn\'92t seen \
the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to \
tell them off anyway. \
\
\'93What\'92s that you\'92ve got there, Potter?\'94 \
\
It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him. \
\
\
\
Page | 203 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Library books are not to be taken outside the \
school,\'94 said Snape. \'93Give it to me. Five points from \
Gryffindor.\'94 \
\
\'93He\'92s just made that rule up,\'94 Harry muttered angrily \
as Snape limped away. \'93Wonder what\'92s wrong with \
his leg?\'94 \
\
\'93Dunno, but I hope it\'92s really hurting him,\'94 said Ron \
bitterly. \
\
The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that \
evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next \
to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron\'92s \
Charms homework for them. She would never let \
them copy (\'93How will you learn?\'94), but by asking her \
to read it through, they got the right answers anyway. \
\
Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the \
Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about \
tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting \
up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask \
Snape if he could have it. \
\
\'93Better you than me,\'94 they said together, but Harry \
had an idea that Snape wouldn\'92t refuse if there were \
other teachers listening. \
\
He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. \
There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing. \
\
Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was \
worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered \
inside \'97 and a horrible scene met his eyes. \
\
Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was \
holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was \
bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape \
bandages. \
\
Page | 204 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Blasted thing,\'94 Snape was saying. \'93How are you \
supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at \
once?\'94 \
\
Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but \'97 \
\
\'93POTTER!\'94 \
\
Snape \'92s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his \
robes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped. \
\
\'93I just wondered if I could have my book back.\'94 \
\
\'93GET OUT! OUT!\'94 \
\
Harry left, before Snape could take any more points \
from Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs. \
\
\'93Did you get it?\'94 Ron asked as Harry joined them. \
\'93What\'92s the matter?\'94 \
\
In a low whisper, Harry told them what he\'92d seen. \
\
\'93You know what this means?\'94 he finished \
breathlessly. \'93He tried to get past that three-headed \
dog at Halloween! That\'92s where he was going when we \
saw him \'97 he\'92s after whatever it\'92s guarding! And I\'92d \
bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a \
diversion!\'94 \
\
Hermione\'92s eyes were wide. \
\
\'93No \'97 he wouldn\'92t,\'94 she said. \'93I know he\'92s not very \
nice, but he wouldn\'92t try and steal something \
Dumbledore was keeping safe.\'94 \
\
\'93Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints \
or something,\'94 snapped Ron. \'93I\'92m with Harry. I \
\
\
\
Page | 205 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
wouldn\'92t put anything past Snape. But what\'92s he \
after? What\'92s that dog guarding?\'94 \
\
Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the \
same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry \
couldn\'92t sleep. He tried to empty his mind \'97 he \
needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch \
match in a few hours \'97 but the expression on \
Snape\'92s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn\'92t easy \
to forget. \
\
The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The \
Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried \
sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking \
forward to a good Quidditch match. \
\
\'93You\'92ve got to eat some breakfast.\'94 \
\
\'93I don\'92t want anything.\'94 \
\
\'93Just a bit of toast,\'94 wheedled Hermione. \
\
\'93I\'92m not hungry.\'94 \
\
Harry felt terrible. In an hour\'92s time he\'92d be walking \
onto the field. \
\
\'93Harry, you need your strength,\'94 said Seamus \
Finnigan. \'93Seekers are always the ones who get \
clobbered by the other team.\'94 \
\
\'93Thanks, Seamus,\'94 said Harry, watching Seamus pile \
ketchup on his sausages. \
\
By eleven o\'92clock the whole school seemed to be out \
in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many \
students had binoculars. The seats might be raised \
high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what \
was going on sometimes. \
\
Page | 206 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean \
the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for \
Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the \
sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for \
President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had \
done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then \
Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that \
the paint flashed different colors. \
\
Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of \
the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch \
robes (Slytherin would be playing in green) . \
\
Wood cleared his throat for silence. \
\
\'93Okay, men,\'94 he said. \
\
\'93And women,\'94 said Chaser Angelina Johnson. \
\
\'93And women,\'94 Wood agreed. \'93This is it.\'94 \
\
\'93The big one,\'94 said Fred Weasley. \
\
\'93The one we\'92ve all been waiting for,\'94 said George. \
\
\'93We know Oliver\'92s speech by heart,\'94 Fred told Harry, \
\'93we were on the team last year.\'94 \
\
\'93Shut up, you two,\'94 said Wood. \'93This is the best team \
Gryffindor\'92s had in years. We\'92re going to win. I know \
it.\'94 \
\
He glared at them all as if to say, \'93Or else.\'94 \
\
\'93Right. It\'92s time. Good luck, all of you.\'94 \
\
Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker \
room and, hoping his knees weren\'92t going to give way, \
walked onto the field to loud cheers. \
\
Page | 207 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the \
middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her \
broom in her hand. \
\
\'93Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,\'94 she said, \
once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed \
that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the \
Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth year. Harry \
thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in \
him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering \
banner high above, flashing Potter for President over \
the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver. \
\
\'93Mount your brooms, please.\'94 \
\
Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand. \
\
Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle. \
\
Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They \
were off. \
\
\'93And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina \
Johnson of Gryffindor \'97 what an excellent Chaser \
that girl is, and rather attractive, too \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93JORDAN!\'94 \
\
\'93Sorry, Professor.\'94 \
\
The Weasley twins\'92 friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the \
commentary for the match, closely watched by \
Professor McGonagall. \
\
\'93And she\'92s really belting along up there, a neat pass \
to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood\'92s, last \
year only a reserve \'97 back to Johnson and \'97 no, the \
Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain \
Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes \'97 Flint \
Page | 208 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
flying like an eagle up there \'97 he\'92s going to sc- no, \
stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper \
Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle \'97 that\'92s \
Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive \
around Flint, off up the field and \'97 OUCH \'97 that \
must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a \
Bludger \'97 Quaffle taken by the Slytherins \'97 that\'92s \
Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but \
he\'92s blocked by a second Bludger \'97 sent his way by \
Fred or George Weasley, can\'92t tell which \'97 nice play \
by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back \
in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and \
off she goes \'97 she\'92s really flying \'97 dodges a speeding \
Bludger \'97 the goal posts are ahead \'97 come on, now, \
Angelina \'97 Keeper Bletchley dives \'97 misses \'97 \
GRYFFINDORS SCORE!\'94 \
\
Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and \
moans from the Slytherins. \
\
\'93Budge up there, move along.\'94 \
\
\'93Hagrid!\'94 \
\
Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid \
enough space to join them. \
\
\'93Bin watchin\'92 from me hut,\'94 said Hagrid, patting a \
large pair of binoculars around his neck, \'93But it isn\'92t \
the same as bein\'92 in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch \
yet, eh?\'94 \
\
\'93Nope,\'94 said Ron. \'93Harry hasn\'92t had much to do yet.\'94 \
\
\'93Kept outta trouble, though, that\'92s somethin\'92,\'94 said \
Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at \
the speck that was Harry. \
\
\
\
Page | 209 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, \
squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was \
part of his and Wood\'92s game plan. \
\
\'93Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the \
Snitch,\'94 Wood had said. \'93We don\'92t want you attacked \
before you have to be.\'94 \
\
When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple \
of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was \
back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught \
sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection \
from one of the Weasleys\'92 wristwatches, and once a \
Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a \
cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and \
Fred Weasley came chasing after it. \
\
\'93All right there, Harry?\'94 he had time to yell, as he \
beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint. \
\
\'93Slytherin in possession,\'94 Lee Jordan was saying, \
\'93Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, \
and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the \'97 wait a \
moment \'97 was that the Snitch?\'94 \
\
A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey \
dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his \
shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left \
ear. \
\
Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived \
downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker \
Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they \
hurtled toward the Snitch \'97 all the Chasers seemed \
to have forgotten what they were supposed to be \
doing as they hung in midair to watch. \
\
\
\

\
\
\
\
Harry was faster than Higgs \'97 he could see the little \
round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead \'97 he \
put on an extra spurt of speed \'97 \
\
WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors \
below \'97 Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, \
and Harry\'92s broom spun off course, Harry holding on \
for dear life. \
\
\'93Foul!\'94 screamed the Gryffindors. \
\
Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered \
a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all \
the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had \
disappeared from sight again. \
\
Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, \'93Send \
him off, ref! Red card!\'94 \
\
\'93What are you talking about, Dean?\'94 said Ron. \
\
\'93Red card!\'94 said Dean furiously. \'93In soccer you get \
shown the red card and you\'92re out of the game!\'94 \
\
\'93But this isn\'92t soccer, Dean,\'94 Ron reminded him. \
\
Hagrid, however, was on Dean\'92s side. \
\
\'93They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked \
Harry outta the air.\'94 \
\
Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides. \
\
\'93So \'97 after that obvious and disgusting bit of \
cheating \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Jordan!\'94 growled Professor McGonagall. \
\
\'93I mean, after that open and revolting foul \'97 \'94 \
\
Page | 211 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Jordan, I\'92m warning you \'97 \'94 \
\
\
\
\'93All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor \
Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I\'92m sure, so a \
penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it \
away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor \
still in possession.\'94 \
\
It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went \
spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. \
His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a \
split second, he thought he was going to fall. He \
gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and \
knees. He\'92d never felt anything like that. \
\
It happened again. It was as though the broom was \
trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands \
did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry \
tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal posts \'97 \
he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out \'97 \
and then he realized that his broom was completely \
out of his control. He couldn\'92t turn it. He couldn\'92t \
direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and \
every now and then making violent swishing \
movements that almost unseated him. \
\
Lee was still commentating. \
\
\'93Slytherin in possession \'97 Flint with the Quaffle \'97 \
passes Spinnet \'97 passes Bell \'97 hit hard in the face \
by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose \'97 only joking, \
Professor \'97 Slytherins score \'97 oh no ...\'94 \
\
The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have \
noticed that Harry\'92s broom was behaving strangely It \
was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, \
jerking and twitching as it went. \
\
\
\
Page | 212 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Dunno what Harry thinks he\'92s doing,\'94 Hagrid \
mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. \'93If I \
didn\'92 know better, I\'92d say he\'92d lost control of his \
broom ... but he can\'92t have. ...\'94 \
\
Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over \
the stands. His broom had started to roll over and \
over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then \
the whole crowd gasped. Harry\'92s broom had given a \
wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling \
from it, holding on with only one hand. \
\
\'93Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?\'94 \
Seamus whispered. \
\
\'93Can\'92t have,\'94 Hagrid said, his voice shaking. \'93Can\'92t \
nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful \
Dark magic \'97 no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two \
Thousand.\'94 \
\
At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid \'92s binoculars, \
but instead of looking up at Harry, she started \
looking frantically at the crowd. \
\
\'93What are you doing?\'94 moaned Ron, gray-faced. \
\
\'93I knew it,\'94 Hermione gasped, \'93Snape \'97 look.\'94 \
\
Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle \
of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on \
Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath. \
\
\'93He\'92s doing something \'97 jinxing the broom,\'94 said \
Hermione. \
\
\'93What should we do?\'94 \
\
\'93Leave it to me.\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 213 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had \
disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on \
Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost \
impossible for him to hang on much longer. The \
whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the \
Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one \
of their brooms, but it was no good \'97 every time they \
got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They \
dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously \
hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the \
Quaffle and scored five times without anyone \
noticing. \
\
\'93Come on, Hermione,\'94 Ron muttered desperately. \
\
Hermione had fought her way across to the stand \
where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row \
behind him; she didn\'92t even stop to say sorry as she \
knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in \
front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled \
out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen \
words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto \
the hem of Snape \'92s robes. \
\
It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize \
that he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had \
done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar \
in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row \'97 \
Snape would never know what had happened. \
\
It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able \
to clamber back on to his broom. \
\
\'93Neville, you can look!\'94 Ron said. Neville had been \
sobbing into Hagrid\'92s jacket for the last five minutes. \
\
Harry was speeding toward the ground when the \
crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though \
\
\
\
Page | 214 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
he was about to be sick \'97 he hit the field on all fours \
\'97 coughed \'97 and something gold fell into his hand. \
\
\'93I\'92ve got the Snitch!\'94 he shouted, waving it above his \
head, and the game ended in complete confusion. \
\
\'93He didn\'92t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,\'94 Flint was \
still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no \
difference \'97 Harry hadn\'92t broken any rules and Lee \
Jordan was still happily shouting the results \'97 \
Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy \
points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He \
was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid\'92s \
hut, with Ron and Hermione. \
\
\'93It was Snape,\'94 Ron was explaining, \'93Hermione and I \
saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, \
he wouldn\'92t take his eyes off you.\'94 \
\
\'93Rubbish,\'94 said Hagrid, who hadn\'92t heard a word of \
what had gone on next to him in the stands. \'93Why \
would Snape do somethin\'92 like that?\'94 \
\
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, \
wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the \
truth. \
\
\'93I found out something about him,\'94 he told Hagrid. \
\'93He tried to get past that three-headed dog on \
Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal \
whatever it\'92s guarding.\'94 \
\
Hagrid dropped the teapot. \
\
\'93How do you know about Fluffy?\'94 he said. \
\
\'93 Fluffy ?\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 215 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Yeah \'97 he\'92s mine \'97 bought him off a Greek chappie \
I met in the pub las\'92 year \'97 I lent him to Dumbledore \
to guard the \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Yes?\'94 said Harry eagerly. \
\
\'93Now, don\'92t ask me anymore,\'94 said Hagrid gruffly. \
\'93That\'92s top secret, that is.\'94 \
\
\'93But Snape\'92s trying to steal it.\'94 \
\
\'93Rubbish,\'94 said Hagrid again. \'93Snape\'92s a Hogwarts \
teacher, he\'92d do nothin\'92 of the sort.\'94 \
\
\'93So why did he just try and kill Harry?\'94 cried \
Hermione. \
\
The afternoon\'92s events certainly seemed to have \
changed her mind about Snape. \
\
\'93I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I\'92ve read all \
about them! You\'92ve got to keep eye contact, and \
Snape wasn\'92t blinking at all, I saw him!\'94 \
\
\'93I\'92m tellin\'92 yeh, yer wrong!\'94 said Hagrid hotly. \'93I don\'92 \
know why Harry\'92s broom acted like that, but Snape \
wouldn\'92 try an\'92 kill a student! Now, listen to me, all \
three of yeh \'97 yer meddlin\'92 in things that don\'92 \
concern yeh. It\'92s dangerous. You forget that dog, an\'92 \
you forget what it\'92s guardin\'92, that\'92s between Professor \
Dumbledore an\'92 Nicolas Flamel \'97 
\f1 \uc0\u9632 
\f0 \'94 \
\
\'93Aha!\'94 said Harry, \'93so there\'92s someone called Nicolas \
Flamel involved, is there?\'94 \
\
Hagrid looked furious with himself. \

\
THE MIRROR OF ERISED \
\
Christmas was coming. One morning in mid- \
December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in \
several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the \
Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several \
snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, \
bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that \
managed to battle their way through the stormy sky \
to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by \
Hagrid before they could fly off again. \
\
No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the \
Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had \
roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and \
a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. \
Worst of all were Professor Snape\'92s classes down in \
the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist \
before them and they kept as close as possible to \
their hot cauldrons. \
\
\'93I do feel so sorry,\'94 said Draco Malfoy, one Potions \
class, \'93for all those people who have to stay at \
\
\
\
Page | 217 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
Hogwarts for Christmas because they\'92re not wanted \
at home.\'94 \
\
He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and \
Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out \
powdered spine of lion-fish, ignored them. Malfoy had \
been even more unpleasant than usual since the \
Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had \
lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a \
wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as \
Seeker next. Then he\'92d realized that nobody found \
this funny, because they were all so impressed at the \
way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking \
broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone \
back to taunting Harry about having no proper \
family. \
\
It was true that Harry wasn\'92t going back to Privet \
Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come \
around the week before, making a list of students \
who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had \
signed up at once. He didn\'92t feel sorry for himself at \
all; this would probably be the best Christmas he\'92d \
ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, \
because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania \
to visit Charlie. \
\
When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, \
they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. \
Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a \
loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind \
it. \
\
\'93Hi, Hagrid, want any help?\'94 Ron asked, sticking his \
head through the branches. \
\
\'93Nah, I\'92m all right, thanks, Ron.\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 218 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Would you mind moving out of the way?\'94 came \
Malfoy\'92s cold drawl from behind them. \'93Are you trying \
to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be \
gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I \
suppose \'97 that hut of Hagrid\'92s must seem like a \
palace compared to what your family\'92s used to.\'94 \
\
Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs. \
\
\'93WEASLEY!\'94 \
\
Ron let go of the front of Malfoy\'92s robes. \
\
\'93He was provoked, Professor Snape,\'94 said Hagrid, \
sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. \
\'93Malfoy was insultin\'92 his family.\'94 \
\
\'93Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, \
Hagrid,\'94 said Snape silkily. \'93Five points from \
Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn\'92t more. \
Move along, all of you.\'94 \
\
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the \
tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking. \
\
\'93I\'92ll get him,\'94 said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy\'92s \
back, \'93one of these days, I\'92ll get him \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93I hate them both,\'94 said Harry, \'93Malfoy and Snape.\'94 \
\
\'93Come on, cheer up, it\'92s nearly Christmas,\'94 said \
Hagrid. \'93Tell yeh what, come with me an\'92 see the \
Great Hall, looks a treat.\'94 \
\
So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off \
to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and \
Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas \
decorations. \
\
\
\
Page | 219 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Ah, Hagrid, the last tree \'97 put it in the far corner, \
would you?\'94 \
\
The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and \
mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than \
twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the \
room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering \
with hundreds of candles. \
\
\'93How many days you got left until yer holidays?\'94 \
Hagrid asked. \
\
\'93Just one,\'94 said Hermione. \'93And that reminds me \'97 \
Harry, Ron, we\'92ve got half an hour before lunch, we \
should be in the library.\'94 \
\
\'93Oh yeah, you\'92re right,\'94 said Ron, tearing his eyes \
away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden \
bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing \
them over the branches of the new tree. \
\
\'93The library?\'94 said Hagrid, following them out of the \
hall. \'93Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren\'92t yeh?\'94 \
\
\'93Oh, we\'92re not working,\'94 Harry told him brightly. \
\
\'93Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we\'92ve been \
trying to find out who he is.\'94 \
\
\'93You what?\'94 Hagrid looked shocked. \'93Listen here \'97 \
I\'92ve told yeh \'97 drop it. It\'92s nothin\'92 to you what that \
dog\'92s guardin\'92.\'94 \
\
\'93We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that\'92s \
all,\'94 said Hermione. \
\
\'93Unless you\'92d like to tell us and save us the trouble?\'94 \
Harry added. \'93We must\'92ve been through hundreds of \
books already and we can\'92t find him anywhere \'97 just \
\
\
\
Page | 220 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
give us a hint \'97 I know I\'92ve read his name \
somewhere.\'94 \
\
\'93I\'92m sayin\'92 nothin\'92,\'94 said Hagrid flatly. \
\
\'93Just have to find out for ourselves, then,\'94 said Ron, \
and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried \
off to the library. \
\
They had indeed been searching books for Flamel\'92s \
name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how \
else were they going to find out what Snape was \
trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to \
know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might \
have done to get himself into a book. He wasn\'92t in \
Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable \
Magical Names of Our Time ; he was missing, too, from \
Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of \
Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of \
course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of \
thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds \
of narrow rows. \
\
Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had \
decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of \
books and started pulling them off the shelves at \
random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted \
Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel \
wasn\'92t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you \
needed a specially signed note from one of the \
teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he \
knew he\'92d never get one. These were the books \
containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at \
Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying \
advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts. \
\
\'93What are you looking for, boy?\'94 \
\
\'93Nothing,\'94 said Harry. \
\
Page | 221 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather \
duster at him. \
\
\'93You\'92d better get out, then. Go on \'97 out!\'94 \
\
Wishing he\'92d been a bit quicker at thinking up some \
story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione \
had already agreed they\'92d better not ask Madam \
Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure \
she\'92d be able to tell them, but they couldn\'92t risk \
Snape hearing what they were up to. \
\
Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other \
two had found anything, but he wasn\'92t very hopeful. \
They had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as \
they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn\'92t \
surprising they\'92d found nothing. What they really \
needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince \
breathing down their necks. \
\
Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, \
shaking their heads. They went off to lunch. \
\
\'93You will keep looking while I\'92m away, won\'92t you?\'94 \
said Hermione. \'93And send me an owl if you find \
anything.\'94 \
\
\'93And you could ask your parents if they know who \
Flamel is,\'94 said Ron. \'93It\'92d be safe to ask them.\'94 \
\
\'93Very safe, as they\'92re both dentists,\'94 said Hermione. \
\
Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were \
having too good a time to think much about Flamel. \
They had the dormitory to themselves and the \
common room was far emptier than usual, so they \
were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They \
sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a \
toasting fork \'97 bread, English muffins, \
\
Page | 222 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
marshmallows \'97 and plotting ways of getting Malfoy \
expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they \
wouldn\'92t work. \
\
Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This \
was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures \
were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in \
battle. Ron\'92s set was very old and battered. Like \
everything else he owned, it had once belonged to \
someone else in his family \'97 in this case, his \
grandfather. However, old chessmen weren\'92t a \
drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had \
trouble getting them to do what he wanted. \
\
Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had \
lent him, and they didn\'92t trust him at all. He wasn\'92t a \
very good player yet and they kept shouting different \
bits of advice at him, which was confusing. \'93Don\'92t \
send me there, can\'92t you see his knight? Send him, we \
can afford to lose him.\'94 \
\
On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward \
to the next day for the food and the fun, but not \
expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in \
the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a \
small pile of packages at the foot of his bed. \
\
\'93Merry Christmas,\'94 said Ron sleepily as Harry \
scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe. \
\
\'93You, too,\'94 said Harry. \'93Will you look at this? I\'92ve got \
some presents!\'94 \
\
\'93What did you expect, turnips?\'94 said Ron, turning to \
his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry\'92s. \
\
Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in \
thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To \
Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden \
\
Page | 223 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry \
blew it \'97 it sounded a bit like an owl. \
\
A second, very small parcel contained a note. \
\
We received your message and enclose your Christmas \
present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped \
to the note was a fifty-pence piece. \
\
\'93That\'92s friendly,\'94 said Harry. \
\
Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence. \
\
\'93 Weird\\ \'94 he said, \'93What a shape! This is money?\'94 \
\
\'93You can keep it,\'94 said Harry, laughing at how \
pleased Ron was. \'93Hagrid and my aunt and uncle \'97 \
so who sent these?\'94 \
\
\'93I think I know who that one\'92s from,\'94 said Ron, \
turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy \
parcel. \'93My mom. I told her you didn\'92t expect any \
presents and \'97 oh, no,\'94 he groaned, \'93she\'92s made you \
a Weasley sweater.\'94 \
\
Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand- \
knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of \
homemade fudge. \
\
\'93Every year she makes us a sweater,\'94 said Ron, \
unwrapping his own, \'93and mine\'92s always maroon.\'94 \
\
\'93That\'92s really nice of her,\'94 said Harry, trying the \
fudge, which was very tasty. \
\
His next present also contained candy \'97 a large box \
of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione. \
\
\
\
Page | 224 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt \
it. It was very light. He unwrapped it. \
\
Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the \
floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped. \
\
\'93I\'92ve heard of those,\'94 he said in a hushed voice, \
dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he\'92d gotten \
from Hermione. \'93If that\'92s what I think it is \'97 they\'92re \
really rare, and really valuable.\'94 \
\
\'93What is it?\'94 \
\
Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It \
was strange to the touch, like water woven into \
material. \
\
\'93It\'92s an Invisibility Cloak,\'94 said Ron, a look of awe on \
his face. \'93I\'92m sure it is \'97 try it on.\'94 \
\
Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron \
gave a yell. \
\
\'93It is! Look down!\'94 \
\
Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He \
dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection \
looked back at him, just his head suspended in \
midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the \
cloak over his head and his reflection vanished \
completely. \
\
\'93There\'92s a note!\'94 said Ron suddenly. \'93A note fell out of \
it!\'94 \
\
\
\
Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. \
Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen \
before were the following words: \
\
\
\
Page | 225 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Your father left this in my possession before he died. It \
is time it was returned to you. \
\
Use it well. \
\
A Very Merry Christmas to you. \
\
There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron \
was admiring the cloak. \
\
\'93I\'92d give anuthinq for one of these,\'94 he said. \'93Anuthinq. \
What\'92s the matter?\'94 \
\
\'93Nothing,\'94 said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had \
sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his \
father? \
\
Before he could say or think anything else, the \
dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George \
Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly \
out of sight. He didn\'92t feel like sharing it with anyone \
else yet. \
\
\'93Merry Christmas!\'94 \
\
\'93Hey, look \'97 Harry\'92s got a Weasley sweater, too!\'94 \
\
Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one \
with a large yellow F on it, the other a G. \
\
\'93Harry\'92s is better than ours, though,\'94 said Fred, \
holding up Harry\'92s sweater. \'93She obviously makes \
more of an effort if you\'92re not family.\'94 \
\
\'93Why aren\'92t you wearing yours, Ron?\'94 George \
demanded. \'93Come on, get it on, they\'92re lovely and \
warm.\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 226 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93I hate maroon,\'94 Ron moaned halfheartedly as he \
pulled it over his head. \
\
\'93You haven\'92t got a letter on yours,\'94 George observed. \
\
\'93I suppose she thinks you don\'92t forget your name. But \
we\'92re not stupid \'97 we know we\'92re called Gred and \
Forge.\'94 \
\
\'93What\'92s all this noise?\'94 \
\
Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, \
looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway \
through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a \
lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized. \
\
\'93P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we\'92re all \
wearing ours, even Harry got one.\'94 \
\
\'93I \'97 don\'92t \'97 want \'97 \'94 said Percy thickly, as the twins \
forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses \
askew. \
\
\'93And you\'92re not sitting with the prefects today, \
either,\'94 said George. \'93Christmas is a time for family.\'94 \
\
They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms \
pinned to his side by his sweater. \
\
Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas \
dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of \
roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; \
tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich \
gravy and cranberry sauce \'97 and stacks of wizard \
crackers every few feet along the table. These \
fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble \
Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their \
little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. \
Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn\'92t \
just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and \
Page | 227 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from \
the inside exploded a rear admiral\'92s hat and several \
live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore \
had swapped his pointed wizard\'92s hat for a flowered \
bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor \
Flitwick had just read him. \
\
Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. \
Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver Sickle \
embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting \
redder and redder in the face as he called for more \
wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the \
cheek, who, to Harry\'92s amazement, giggled and \
blushed, her top hat lopsided. \
\
When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down \
with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a \
pack of non-explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow- \
Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess \
set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a \
nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. \
Norris\'92s Christmas dinner. \
\
Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon \
having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, \
cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the \
fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry \
broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to \
Ron. He suspected he wouldn\'92t have lost so badly if \
Percy hadn\'92t tried to help him so much. \
\
After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, \
and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy \
to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy \
chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower \
because they\'92d stolen his prefect badge. \
\
It had been Harry\'92s best Christmas day ever. Yet \
something had been nagging at the back of his mind \
\
Page | 228 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to \
think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had \
sent it. \
\
Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing \
mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon \
as he\'92d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry \
leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the \
cloak out from under it. \
\
His father\'92s ... this had been his father\'92s. He let the \
material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light \
as air. Use it well, the note had said. \
\
He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and \
wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at \
his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a \
very funny feeling. \
\
Use it well. \
\
Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of \
Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement \
flooded through him as he stood there in the dark \
and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, \
and Filch would never know. \
\
Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? \
Something held him back \'97 his father\'92s cloak \'97 he \
felt that this time \'97 the first time \'97 he wanted to use \
it alone. \
\
He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across \
the common room, and climbed through the portrait \
hole. \
\
\'93Who\'92s there?\'94 squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said \
nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor. \
\
\
\
Page | 229 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, \
and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted \
Section in the library. He\'92d be able to read as long as \
he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel \
was. He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight \
around him as he walked. \
\
The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a \
lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The \
lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and \
even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, \
the sight gave him the creeps. \
\
The Restricted Section was right at the back of the \
library. Stepping carefully over the rope that \
separated these books from the rest of the library, he \
held up his lamp to read the titles. \
\
They didn\'92t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold \
letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn\'92t \
understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a \
dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The \
hairs on the back of Harry\'92s neck prickled. Maybe he \
was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint \
whispering was coming from the books, as though \
they knew someone was there who shouldn\'92t be. \
\
He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down \
carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom \
shelf for an interesting-looking book. A large black \
and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out \
with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, \
balancing it on his knee, let it fall open. \
\
A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence \'97 \
the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but \
the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, \
earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked \
over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he \
Page | 230 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside \'97 \
stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran \
for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch\'92s pale, \
wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry \
slipped under Filch\'92s outstretched arm and streaked \
off up the corridor, the book\'92s shrieks still ringing in \
his ears. \
\
He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of \
armor. He had been so busy getting away from the \
library, he hadn\'92t paid attention to where he was \
going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn\'92t \
recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of \
armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be \
five floors above there. \
\
\'93You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if \
anyone was wandering around at night, and \
somebody\'92s been in the library \'97 Restricted Section.\'94 \
\
Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he \
was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, \
greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it \
was Snape who replied, \'93The Restricted Section? Well, \
they can\'92t be far, we\'92ll catch them.\'94 \
\
Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape \
came around the corner ahead. They couldn\'92t see \
him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if \
they came much nearer they\'92d knock right into him \'97 \
the cloak didn\'92t stop him from being solid. \
\
He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood \
ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed \
through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, \
and to his relief he managed to get inside the room \
without their noticing anything. They walked straight \
past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing \
deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That \
Page | 231 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
had been close, very close. It was a few seconds \
before he noticed anything about the room he had \
hidden in. \
\
\
\
It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes \
of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and \
there was an upturned wastepaper basket \'97 but \
propped against the wall facing him was something \
that didn\'92t look as if it belonged there, something that \
looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it \
out of the way. \
\
It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, \
with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed \
feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: \
Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. \
\
His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch \
and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, \
wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. \
He stepped in front of it. \
\
He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself \
from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was \
pounding far more furiously than when the book had \
screamed \'97 for he had seen not only himself in the \
mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right \
behind him. \
\
But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he \
turned slowly back to the mirror. \
\
There he was, reflected in it, white and scared- \
looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least \
ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder \'97 but still, \
no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was \
he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this \
mirrors trick was that it reflected them, invisible or \
not? \
\
Page | 232 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing \
right behind his reflection was smiling at him and \
waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind \
him. If she was really there, he\'92d touch her, their \
reflections were so close together, but he felt only air \
\'97 she and the others existed only in the mirror. \
\
She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair \
and her eyes \'97 her eyes are just like mine, Harry \
thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright \
green \'97 exactly the same shape, but then he noticed \
that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same \
time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next \
to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and \
his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just \
as Harry\'92s did. \
\
Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose \
was nearly touching that of his reflection. \
\
\'93Mom?\'94 he whispered. \'93Dad?\'94 \
\
They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry \
looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, \
and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses \
like his, even a little old man who looked as though \
he had Harry\'92s knobbly knees \'97 Harry was looking at \
his family, for the first time in his life. \
\
The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared \
hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against \
the glass as though he was hoping to fall right \
through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of \
ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. \
\
How long he stood there, he didn\'92t know. The \
reflections did not fade and he looked and looked \
until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. \
He couldn\'92t stay here, he had to find his way back to \
\
Page | 233 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother\'92s face, \
whispered, \'93I\'92ll come back,\'94 and hurried from the \
room. \
\
\'93You could have woken me up,\'94 said Ron, crossly. \
\
\'93You can come tonight, I\'92m going back, I want to show \
you the mirror.\'94 \
\
\'93I\'92d like to see your mom and dad,\'94 Ron said eagerly. \
\
\'93And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, \
you\'92ll be able to show me your other brothers and \
everyone.\'94 \
\
\'93You can see them any old time,\'94 said Ron. \'93Just \
come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe \
it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding \
Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why \
aren\'92t you eating anything?\'94 \
\
Harry couldn\'92t eat. He had seen his parents and \
would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost \
forgotten about Flamel. It didn\'92t seem very important \
anymore. Who cared what the three-headed dog was \
guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really? \
\
\'93Are you all right?\'94 said Ron. \'93You look odd.\'94 \
\
What Harry feared most was that he might not be \
able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered \
in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly \
the next night. They tried retracing Harry\'92s route from \
the library, wandering around the dark passageways \
for nearly an hour. \
\
\'93I\'92m freezing,\'94 said Ron. \'93Let\'92s forget it and go back.\'94 \
\
\'93IVo!\'94 Harry hissed. \'93I know it\'92s here somewhere.\'94 \
\
Page | 234 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the \
opposite direction, but saw no one else. Just as Ron \
started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, \
Harry spotted the suit of armor. \
\
\'93It\'92s here \'97 just here \'97 yes!\'94 \
\
They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak \
from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror. \
\
There they were. His mother and father beamed at the \
sight of him. \
\
\'93See?\'94 Harry whispered. \
\
\'93I can\'92t see anything.\'94 \
\
\'93Look! Look at them all ... there are loads of them. ...\'94 \
\'93I can only see you.\'94 \
\
\'93Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.\'94 \
\
Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the \
mirror, he couldn\'92t see his family anymore, just Ron \
in his paisley pajamas. \
\
Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image. \
\'93Look at me!\'94 he said. \
\
\'93Can you see all your family standing around you?\'94 \
\
\'93No \'97 I\'92m alone \'97 but I\'92m different \'97 I look older \'97 \
and I\'92m Head Boy!\'94 \
\
\'93What?\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 235 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93I am \'97 I\'92m wearing the badge like Bill used to \'97 and \
I\'92m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup \'97 \
I\'92m Quidditch captain, too!\'94 \
\
Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to \
look excitedly at Harry. \
\
\'93Do you think this mirror shows the future?\'94 \
\
\'93How can it? All my family are dead \'97 let me have \
another look \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit \
more time.\'94 \
\
\'93You\'92re only holding the Quidditch Cup, what\'92s \
interesting about that? I want to see my parents.\'94 \
\
\'93Don\'92t push me \'97 \'94 \
\
A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to \
their discussion. They hadn\'92t realized how loudly they \
had been talking. \
\
\'93Quick!\'94 \
\
Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous \
eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and \
Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing \
\'97 did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an \
age, she turned and left. \
\
\'93This isn\'92t safe \'97 she might have gone for Filch, I bet \
she heard us. Come on.\'94 \
\
And Ron pulled Harry out of the room. \
\
The snow still hadn\'92t melted the next morning. \
\
\
\
Page | 236 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Want to play chess, Harry?\'94 said Ron. \
\
\
\
\'93No.\'94 \
\
\'93Why don\'92t we go down and visit Hagrid?\'94 \
\
\'93No ... you go ...\'94 \
\
\'93I know what you\'92re thinking about, Harry, that \
mirror. Don\'92t go back tonight.\'94 \
\
\'93Why not?\'94 \
\
\'93I dunno, I\'92ve just got a bad feeling about it \'97 and \
anyway, you\'92ve had too many close shaves already. \
Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. \
So what if they can\'92t see you? What if they walk into \
you? What if you knock something over?\'94 \
\
\'93You sound like Hermione.\'94 \
\
\'93I\'92m serious, Harry, don\'92t go.\'94 \
\
But Harry only had one thought in his head, which \
was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn\'92t \
going to stop him. \
\
That third night he found his way more quickly than \
before. He was walking so fast he knew he was \
making more noise than was wise, but he didn\'92t meet \
anyone. \
\
And there were his mother and father smiling at him \
again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. \
Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the \
mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying \
here all night with his family. Nothing at all. \
\
Except \'97 \
\
Page | 237 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93So \'97 back again, Harry?\'94 \
\
Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He \
looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the \
wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry \
must have walked straight past him, so desperate to \
get to the mirror he hadn\'92t noticed him. \
\
\'93I \'97 I didn\'92t see you, sir.\'94 \
\
\'93Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make \
you,\'94 said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see \
that he was smiling. \
\
\'93So,\'94 said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on \
the floor with Harry, \'93you, like hundreds before you, \
have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.\'94 \
\
\'93I didn\'92t know it was called that, sir.\'94 \
\
\'93But I expect you\'92ve realized by now what it does?\'94 \
\
\'93It \'97 well \'97 it shows me my family \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.\'94 \
\
\'93How did you know \'97 ?\'94 \
\
\'93I don\'92t need a cloak to become invisible,\'94 said \
Dumbledore gently. \'93Now, can you think what the \
Mirror of Erised shows us all?\'94 \
\
Harry shook his head. \
\
\'93Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be \
able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, \
that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly \
as he is. Does that help?\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 238 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Harry thought. Then he said slowly, \'93It shows us \
what we want ... whatever we want ...\'94 \
\
\'93Yes and no,\'94 said Dumbledore quietly. \'93It shows us \
nothing more or less than the deepest, most \
desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never \
known your family, see them standing around you. \
Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed \
by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best \
of all of them. However, this mirror will give us \
neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away \
before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been \
driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or \
even possible. \
\
\'93The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, \
Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If \
you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It \
does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, \
remember that. Now, why don\'92t you put that \
admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?\'94 \
\
Harry stood up. \
\
\'93Sir \'97 Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you \
something?\'94 \
\
\'93Obviously, you\'92ve just done so,\'94 Dumbledore smiled. \
\'93You may ask me one more thing, however.\'94 \
\
\'93What do you see when you look in the mirror?\'94 \
\
\'93I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\'94 \
\
Harry stared. \
\
\'93One can never have enough socks,\'94 said \
Dumbledore. \'93Another Christmas has come and gone \
\
\
\
Page | 239 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
and I didn\'92t get a single pair. People will insist on \
giving me books.\'94 \
\
It was only when he was back in bed that it struck \
Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite \
truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved \
Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal \
question. \
\
\
\

\
\
NICHOLAS FLAMBL \
\
Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking \
for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the \
Christmas holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed \
folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he \
could forget what he\'92d seen in the mirror as easily, \
but he couldn\'92t. He started having nightmares. Over \
and over again he dreamed about his parents \
disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high \
voice cackled with laughter. \
\
\'93You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could \
drive you mad,\'94 said Ron, when Harry told him about \
these dreams. \
\
Hermione, who came back the day before term \
started, took a different view of things. She was torn \
between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, \
roaming the school three nights in a row (\'93If Filch had \
caught you!\'94), and disappointment that he hadn\'92t at \
least found out who Nicolas Flamel was. \
\
\
\
Page | 241 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel \
in a library book, even though Harry was still sure \
he\'92d read the name somewhere. Once term had \
started, they were back to skimming through books \
for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even \
less time than the other two, because Quidditch \
practice had started again. \
\
Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even \
the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn\'92t \
dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that \
Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on \
Wood\'92s side. If they won their next match, against \
Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the \
House Championship for the first time in seven years. \
Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he \
had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after \
training. \
\
Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice \
session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He\'92d \
just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept \
dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off \
their brooms. \
\
\'93Will you stop messing around!\'94 he yelled. \'93That\'92s \
exactly the sort of thing that\'92ll lose us the match! \
Snape\'92s refereeing this time, and he\'92ll be looking for \
any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\'94 \
\
George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these \
words. \
\
\'93 Snape\'92s refereeing?\'94 he spluttered through a \
mouthful of mud. \'93When\'92s he ever refereed a \
Quidditch match? He\'92s not going to be fair if we might \
overtake Slytherin.\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 242 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
The rest of the team landed next to George to \
complain, too. \
\
\'93It\'92s not my fault,\'94 said Wood. \'93We\'92ve just got to make \
sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn\'92t got an \
excuse to pick on us.\'94 \
\
Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had \
another reason for not wanting Snape near him while \
he was playing Quidditch. ... \
\
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another \
as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed \
straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where \
he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was \
the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry \
and Ron thought was very good for her. \
\
\'93Don\'92t talk to me for a moment,\'94 said Ron when Harry \
sat down next to him, \'93I need to concern\'94 He caught \
sight of Harry\'92s face. \'93What\'92s the matter with you? \
\
You look terrible.\'94 \
\
Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, \
\
Harry told the other two about Snape \'92s sudden, \
sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee. \
\
\'93Don\'92t play,\'94 said Hermione at once. \
\
\'93Say you\'92re ill,\'94 said Ron. \
\
\'93Pretend to break your leg,\'94 Hermione suggested. \
\
\'93 Really break your leg,\'94 said Ron. \
\
\'93I can\'92t,\'94 said Harry. \'93There isn\'92t a reserve Seeker. If I \
back out, Gryffindor can\'92t play at all.\'94 \
\

\
\
\
At that moment Neville toppled into the common \
room. How he had managed to climb through the \
portrait hole was anyone\'92s guess, because his legs \
had been stuck together with what they recognized at \
once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to \
bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower. \
\
Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who \
leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville\'92s \
legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. \
\
\'93What happened?\'94 Hermione asked him, leading him \
over to sit with Harry and Ron. \
\
\'93Malfoy,\'94 said Neville shakily. \'93I met him outside the \
library. He said he\'92d been looking for someone to \
practice that on.\'94 \
\
\'93Go to Professor McGonagall!\'94 Hermione urged \
Neville. \'93Report him!\'94 \
\
Neville shook his head. \
\
\'93I don\'92t want more trouble,\'94 he mumbled. \
\
\'93You\'92ve got to stand up to him, Neville!\'94 said Ron. \
\'93He\'92s used to walking all over people, but that\'92s no \
reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.\'94 \
\
\'93There\'92s no need to tell me I\'92m not brave enough to be \
in Gryffindor, Malfoy\'92s already done that,\'94 Neville \
choked out. \
\
Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a \
Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box \
Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to \
Neville, who looked as though he might cry. \
\
\
\
Page | 244 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93You\'92re worth twelve of Malfoy,\'94 Harry said. \'93The \
Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn\'92t it? And \
where\'92s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.\'94 \
\
Neville\'92s lips twitched in a weak smile as he \
unwrapped the frog. \
\
\'93Thanks, Harry ... I think I\'92ll go to bed. ... D\'92you want \
the card, you collect them, don\'92t you?\'94 \
\
As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous \
Wizard card. \
\
\'93Dumbledore again,\'94 he said, \'93He was the first one I \
ever \'97 \'94 \
\
He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he \
looked up at Ron and Hermione. \
\
\'93I\'92ve found him\\\'94 he whispered. \'93I\'92ve found Flamel! I \
told you I\'92d read the name somewhere before, I read it \
on the train coming here \'97 listen to this: \
\
\'91Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of \
the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the \
discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\'92s blood, and his \
work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel\'92V\'92 \
\
Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn\'92t looked so \
excited since they\'92d gotten back the marks for their \
very first piece of homework. \
\
\'93Stay there!\'94 she said, and she sprinted up the stairs \
to the girls\'92 dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had \
time to exchange mystified looks before she was \
dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms. \
\
\'93I never thought to look in here!\'94 she whispered \
excitedly. \'93I got this out of the library weeks ago for a \
bit of light reading.\'94 \
\
Page | 245 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Light?\'94 said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet \
until she\'92d looked something up, and started flicking \
frantically through the pages, muttering to herself. \
\
At last she found what she was looking for. \
\
\'93I knew it! I knew it!\'94 \
\
\'93Are we allowed to speak yet?\'94 said Ron grumpily. \
Hermione ignored him. \
\
\'93Nicolas Flamel,\'94 she whispered dramatically, \'93is the \
only known maker of the Sorcerer\'92s Stone\\\'94 \
\
This didn\'92t have quite the effect she\'92d expected. \
\
\'93The what?\'94 said Harry and Ron. \
\
\'93Oh, honestly , don\'92t you two read? Look \'97 read that, \
there.\'94 \
\
She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and \
Ron read: \
\
The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with \
making the Sorcerer\'92s Stone, a legendary substance \
with astonishing powers. The Stone will transform \
any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of \
Life, which will make the drinker immortal. \
\
There have been many reports of the Sorcerer\'92s Stone \
over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in \
existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted \
alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated \
his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, \
enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle \
(six hundred and fifty-eight). \
\
\
\
Page | 246 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93See?\'94 said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had \
finished. \'93The dog must be guarding Flamel\'92s \
Sorcerer\'92s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep \
it safe for him, because they\'92re friends and he knew \
someone was after it, that\'92s why he wanted the Stone \
moved out of Gringotts!\'94 \
\
\'93A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever \
dying!\'94 said Harry. \'93No wonder Snape\'92s after it! \
\
Anyone would want it.\'94 \
\
\'93And no wonder we couldn\'92t find Flamel in that Study \
of Recent Developments in Wizardry,\'94 said Ron. \'93He\'92s \
not exactly recent if he\'92s six hundred and sixty-five, is \
he?\'94 \
\
The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, \
while copying down different ways of treating werewolf \
bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they\'92d \
do with a Sorcerer\'92s Stone if they had one. It wasn\'92t \
until Ron said he\'92d buy his own Quidditch team that \
Harry remembered about Snape and the coming \
match. \
\
\'93I\'92m going to play,\'94 he told Ron and Hermione. \'93If I \
don\'92t, all the Slytherins will think I\'92m just too scared \
to face Snape. I\'92ll show them ... it\'92ll really wipe the \
smiles off their faces if we win.\'94 \
\
\'93Just as long as we\'92re not wiping you off the field,\'94 \
said Hermione. \
\
As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became \
more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and \
Hermione. The rest of the team wasn\'92t too calm, \
either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the House \
Championship was wonderful, no one had done it for \
seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such \
a biased referee? \
\
Page | 247 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Harry didn\'92t know whether he was imagining it or not, \
but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever \
he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape \
was following him, trying to catch him on his own. \
Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly \
torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape \
possibly know they\'92d found out about the Sorcerer\'92s \
Stone? Harry didn\'92t see how he could \'97 yet he \
sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could \
read minds. \
\
Harry knew, when they wished him good luck \
outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron \
and Hermione were wondering whether they\'92d ever \
see him alive again. This wasn\'92t what you\'92d call \
comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood\'92s pep \
talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked \
up his Nimbus Two Thousand. \
\
Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in \
the stands next to Neville, who couldn\'92t understand \
why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had \
both brought their wands to the match. Little did \
Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly \
practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They\'92d gotten the \
idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready \
to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to \
hurt Harry. \
\
\'93Now, don\'92t forget, it\'92s Locomotor Mortis,\'94 Hermione \
muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve. \
\
\'93I know,\'94 Ron snapped. \'93Don\'92t nag.\'94 \
\
Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry \
aside. \
\
\'93Don\'92t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever \
need an early capture of the Snitch it\'92s now. Finish \
\
Page | 248 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too \
much.\'94 \
\
\'93The whole school\'92s out there!\'94 said Fred Weasley, \
peering out of the door. \'93Even \'97 blimey \'97 \
Dumbledore\'92s come to watch!\'94 \
\
Harry\'92s heart did a somersault. \
\
\'93Dumbledore?\'94 he said, dashing to the door to make \
sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that \
silver beard. \
\
Harry could have laughed out loud with relief. He was \
safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare \
to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching. \
\
Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as \
the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron \
noticed, too. \
\
\'93I\'92ve never seen Snape look so mean,\'94 he told \
Hermione. \'93Look \'97 they\'92re off. Ouch!\'94 \
\
Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It \
was Malfoy. \
\
\'93Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn\'92t see you there.\'94 \
\
Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle. \
\
\'93Wonder how long Potter\'92s going to stay on his broom \
this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, \
Weasley?\'94 \
\
Ron didn\'92t answer; Snape had just awarded \
Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit \
a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers \
crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, \
\
Page | 249 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the \
Snitch. \
\
\'93You know how I think they choose people for the \
Gryffindor team?\'94 said Malfoy loudly a few minutes \
later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty \
for no reason at all. \'93It\'92s people they feel sorry for. \
\
See, there\'92s Potter, who\'92s got no parents, then there\'92s \
the Weasleys, who\'92ve got no money \'97 you should be \
on the team, Longbottom, you\'92ve got no brains.\'94 \
\
Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face \
Malfoy. \
\
\'93I\'92m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,\'94 he stammered. \
\
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but \
Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, \
said, \'93You tell him, Neville.\'94 \
\
\'93Longbottom, if brains were gold you\'92d be poorer than \
Weasley, and that\'92s saying something.\'94 \
\
Ron\'92s nerves were already stretched to the breaking \
point with anxiety about Harry. \
\
\'93I\'92m warning you, Malfoy \'97 one more word \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Ron!\'94 said Hermione suddenly, \'93Harry \'97 !\'94 \
\
\'93What? Where?\'94 \
\
Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, \
which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. \
Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, \
as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet. \
\
\'93You\'92re in luck, Weasley, Potter\'92s obviously spotted \
some money on the ground!\'94 said Malfoy. \
\
Page | 250 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was \
happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to \
the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the \
back of his seat to help. \
\
\'93Come on, Harry!\'94 Hermione screamed, leaping onto \
her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape \'97 \
she didn\'92t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around \
under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from \
the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle. \
\
Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in \
time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing \
him by inches \'97 the next second, Harry had pulled \
out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch \
clasped in his hand. \
\
The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one \
could ever remember the Snitch being caught so \
quickly. \
\
\'93Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game\'92s over! Harry\'92s \
won! We\'92ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!\'94 shrieked \
Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and \
hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front. \
\
Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. \
He couldn\'92t believe it. He\'92d done it \'97 the game was \
over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors \
came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land \
nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped \'97 then Harry felt \
a hand on his shoulder and looked up into \
Dumbledore\'92s smiling face. \
\
\'93Well done,\'94 said Dumbledore quietly, so that only \
Harry could hear. \'93Nice to see you haven\'92t been \
brooding about that mirror . . . been keeping busy . . . \
excellent ...\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 251 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Snape spat bitterly on the ground. \
\
\
\
Jc Jc Jc \
\
\
\
Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to \
take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the \
broomshed. He couldn\'92t ever remember feeling \
happier. He\'92d really done something to be proud of \
now \'97 no one could say he was just a famous name \
any more. The evening air had never smelled so \
sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the \
last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: \
Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; \
Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and \
down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed. \
\
Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the \
wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its \
windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in \
the lead. He\'92d done it, he\'92d shown Snape. ... \
\
And speaking of Snape . . . \
\
A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of \
the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked \
as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. \
Harry\'92s victory faded from his mind as he watched. \
He recognized the figure\'92s prowling walk. Snape, \
sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at \
dinner \'97 what was going on? \
\
Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand \
and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw \
Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed. \
\
The trees were so thick he couldn\'92t see where Snape \
had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, \
brushing the top branches of trees until he heard \
\
\
\
Page | 252 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly \
in a towering beech tree. \
\
He climbed carefully along one of the branches, \
holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through \
the leaves. \
\
Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he \
wasn\'92t alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn\'92t \
make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering \
worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they \
were saying. \
\
"... d-don\'92t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of \
all p-places, Severus ...\'94 \
\
\'93Oh, I thought we\'92d keep this private,\'94 said Snape, his \
voice icy. \'93Students aren\'92t supposed to know about \
the Sorcerer\'92s Stone, after all.\'94 \
\
Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling \
something. Snape interrupted him. \
\
\'93Have you found out how to get past that beast of \
Hagrid\'92s yet?\'94 \
\
\'93B-b-but Severus, I \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93You don\'92t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,\'94 said \
Snape, taking a step toward him. \
\
\'93I-I don\'92t know what you \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93You know perfectly well what I mean.\'94 \
\
An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the \
tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, \
\
\'93 \'97 your little bit of hocus-pocus. I\'92m waiting.\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 253 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93B-but I d-d-don\'92t \'97 \'94 \
\
\
\
\'93Very well,\'94 Snape cut in. \'93Well have another little \
chat soon, when you\'92ve had time to think things over \
and decided where your loyalties lie.\'94 \
\
He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the \
clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see \
Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was \
petrified. \
\
\
\
Jc Jc Jc \
\
\
\
\'93Harry, where have you been?\'94 Hermione squeaked. \
\
\'93We won! You won! We won!\'94 shouted Ron, thumping \
Harry on the back. \'93And I gave Malfoy a black eye, \
and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single- \
handed! He\'92s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says \
he\'92ll be all right \'97 talk about showing Slytherin! \
Everyone\'92s waiting for you in the common room, we\'92re \
having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and \
stuff from the kitchens.\'94 \
\
\'93Never mind that now,\'94 said Harry breathlessly. \'93Let\'92s \
find an empty room, you wait \'92til you hear this. ...\'94 \
\
He made sure Peeves wasn\'92t inside before shutting \
the door behind them, then he told them what he\'92d \
seen and heard. \
\
\'93So we were right, it is the Sorcerer\'92s Stone, and \
Snape\'92s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He \
asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy \'97 and he said \
something about Quirrell\'92s \'91hocus-pocus\'92 \'97 I reckon \
there are other things guarding the stone apart from \
Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell \
\
\
\
Page | 254 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that \
Snape needs to break through \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93So you mean the Stone\'92s only safe as long as Quirrell \
stands up to Snape?\'94 said Hermione in alarm. \
\
\'93It\'92ll be gone by next Tuesday,\'94 said Ron. \

\
Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they\'92d \
thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be \
getting paler and thinner, but it didn\'92t look as though \
he\'92d cracked yet. \
\
Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, \
Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door \
to check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape \
was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which \
surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever \
Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an \
encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling \
people off for laughing at Quirrell\'92s stutter. \
\
Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the \
Sorcerer\'92s Stone. She had started drawing up study \
schedules and color-coding all her notes. Harry and \
Ron wouldn\'92t have minded, but she kept nagging \
them to do the same. \
\
\
\

\
\
\
\'93Hermione, the exams are ages away.\'94 \
\
\'93Ten weeks,\'94 Hermione snapped. \'93That\'92s not ages, \
that\'92s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.\'94 \
\
\'93But we\'92re not six hundred years old,\'94 Ron reminded \
her. \'93Anyway, what are you studying for, you already \
know it all.\'94 \
\
\'93What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize \
we need to pass these exams to get into the second \
year? They\'92re very important, I should have started \
studying a month ago, I don\'92t know what\'92s gotten into \
me.\'94 \
\
Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking \
along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so \
much homework on them that the Easter holidays \
weren\'92t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It \
was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting \
the twelve uses of dragon\'92s blood or practicing wand \
movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron \
spent most of their free time in the library with her, \
trying to get through all their extra work. \
\
\'93I\'92ll never remember this,\'94 Ron burst out one \
afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking \
longingly out of the library window. It was the first \
really fine day they\'92d had in months. The sky was a \
clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in \
the air of summer coming. \
\
Harry, who was looking up \'93Dittany\'94 in One Thousand \
Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn\'92t look up until he \
heard Ron say, \'93Hagrid! What are you doing in the \
library?\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 257 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind \
his back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin \
overcoat. \
\
\'93Jus\'92 lookin\'92,\'94 he said, in a shifty voice that got their \
interest at once. \'93An\'92 what\'92re you lot up ter?\'94 He \
looked suddenly suspicious. \'93Yer not still lookin\'92 fer \
Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?\'94 \
\
\'93Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,\'94 said Ron \
impressively. \'93And we know what that dog\'92s guarding, \
it\'92s a Sorcerer\'92s St \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Shhhh\\\'94 Hagrid looked around quickly to see if \
anyone was listening. \'93Don\'92 go shoutin\'92 about it, \
what\'92s the matter with yeh?\'94 \
\
\'93There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a \
matter of fact,\'94 said Harry, \'93about what\'92s guarding \
the Stone apart from Fluffy \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93SHHHH!\'94 said Hagrid again. \'93Listen \'97 come an\'92 see \
me later, I\'92m not promisin\'92 I\'92ll tell yeh anythin\'92, mind, \
but don\'92 go rabbitin\'92 about it in here, students aren\'92 \
s\'92pposed ter know. They\'92ll think I\'92ve told yeh \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93See you later, then,\'94 said Harry. \
\
Hagrid shuffled off. \
\
\'93What was he hiding behind his back?\'94 said \
Hermione thoughtfully. \
\
\'93Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?\'94 \
\
\'93I\'92m going to see what section he was in,\'94 said Ron, \
who\'92d had enough of working. He came back a \
minute later with a pile of books in his arms and \
slammed them down on the table. \
\
Page | 258 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Dragons'.\'94 he whispered. \'93Hagrid was looking up stuff \
about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great \
Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon \
Keeper\'92s Guide.\'94 \
\
\'93Hagrid \'92s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the \
first time I ever met him,\'94 said Harry. \
\
\'93But it\'92s against our laws,\'94 said Ron. \'93Dragon \
breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks\'92 Convention \
of 1709, everyone knows that. It\'92s hard to stop \
Muggles from noticing us if we\'92re keeping dragons in \
the back garden \'97 anyway, you can\'92t tame dragons, \
it\'92s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie\'92s got \
off wild ones in Romania.\'94 \
\
\'93But there aren\'92t wild dragons in Britain?\'94 said Harry. \
\
\'93Of course there are,\'94 said Ron. \'93Common Welsh \
Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic \
has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind \
have to keep putting spells on Muggles who\'92ve spotted \
them, to make them forget.\'94 \
\
\'93So what on earth\'92s Hagrid up to?\'94 said Hermione. \
\
When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper\'92s \
hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all \
the curtains were closed. Hagrid called \'93Who is it?\'94 \
before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly \
behind them. \
\
It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a \
warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. \
\
Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat \
sandwiches, which they refused. \
\
\'93So \'97 yeh wanted to ask me somethin\'92?\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 259 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said Harry. There was no point beating around \
the bush. \'93We were wondering if you could tell us \
what\'92s guarding the Sorcerer\'92s Stone apart from \
Fluffy.\'94 \
\
Hagrid frowned at him. \
\
\'93O\'92 course I can\'92t,\'94 he said. \'93Number one, I don\'92 know \
meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I \
wouldn\'92 tell yeh if I could. That Stone\'92s here fer a good \
reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts \'97 I \
s\'92ppose yeh\'92ve worked that out an\'92 all? Beats me how \
yeh even know abou\'92 Fluffy.\'94 \
\
\'93Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, \
but you do know, you know everything that goes on \
round here,\'94 said Hermione in a warm, flattering \
voice. Hagrid \'92s beard twitched and they could tell he \
was smiling. \'93We only wondered who had done the \
guarding, really.\'94 Hermione went on. \'93We wondered \
who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, \
apart from you.\'94 \
\
Hagrid \'92s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and \
Ron beamed at Hermione. \
\
\'93Well, I don\'92 s\'92pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that ... \
let\'92s see ... he borrowed Fluffy from me ... then some \
o\'92 the teachers did enchantments ... Professor Sprout \
\'97 Professor Flitwick \'97 Professor McGonagall \'97 \'94 he \
ticked them off on his fingers, \'93Professor Quirrell \'97 \
an\'92 Dumbledore himself did somethin\'92, o\'92 course. \
\
Hang on, I\'92ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor \
Snape.\'94 \
\
\'93Snape?\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 260 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Yeah \'97 yer not still on abou\'92 that, are yeh? Look, \
Snape helped protect the Stone, he\'92s not about ter \
steal it.\'94 \
\
Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the \
same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting \
the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the \
other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew \
everything \'97 except, it seemed, Quirrell\'92s spell and \
how to get past Fluffy. \
\
\'93You\'92re the only one who knows how to get past \
Fluffy, aren\'92t you, Hagrid?\'94 said Harry anxiously. \
\
\'93And you wouldn\'92t tell anyone, would you? Not even \
one of the teachers?\'94 \
\
\'93Not a soul knows except me an\'92 Dumbledore,\'94 said \
Hagrid proudly. \
\
\'93Well, that\'92s something,\'94 Harry muttered to the \
others. \'93Hagrid, can we have a window open? I\'92m \
boiling.\'94 \
\
\'93Can\'92t, Harry, sorry,\'94 said Hagrid. Harry noticed him \
glance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too. \
\
\'93Hagrid \'97 what\'92s that?\'94 \
\
But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of \
the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg. \
\
\'93Ah,\'94 said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, \
\'93That\'92s \'97 er ...\'94 \
\
\'93Where did you get it, Hagrid?\'94 said Ron, crouching \
over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. \'93It must\'92ve \
cost you a fortune.\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 261 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Won it,\'94 said Hagrid. \'93Las\'92 night. I was down in the \
village havin\'92 a few drinks an\'92 got into a game o\'92 cards \
with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of \
it, ter be honest.\'94 \
\
\'93But what are you going to do with it when it\'92s \
hatched?\'94 said Hermione. \
\
\'93Well, I\'92ve bin doin\'92 some readin\'92,\'94 said Hagrid, pulling \
a large book from under his pillow. \'93Got this outta the \
library \'97 Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit \'97 \
it\'92s a bit outta date, o\'92 course, but it\'92s all in here. Keep \
the egg in the fire, \'92cause their mothers breathe on \
\'92em, see, an\'92 when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o\'92 \
brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An\'92 \
see here \'97 how ter recognize diff\'92rent eggs \'97 what I \
got there\'92s a Norwegian Ridge-back. They\'92re rare, \
them.\'94 \
\
He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione \
didn\'92t. \
\
\'93Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,\'94 she said. \
\
But Hagrid wasn\'92t listening. He was humming merrily \
as he stoked the fire. \
\
So now they had something else to worry about: what \
might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was \
hiding an illegal dragon in his hut. \
\
\'93Wonder what it\'92s like to have a peaceful life,\'94 Ron \
sighed, as evening after evening they struggled \
through all the extra homework they were getting. \
Hermione had now started making study schedules \
for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts. \
\
\
\
Page | 262 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry \
another note from Hagrid. He had written only two \
words: It\'92s hatching. \
\
Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to \
the hut. Hermione wouldn\'92t hear of it. \
\
\'93Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going \
to see a dragon hatching?\'94 \
\
\'93We\'92ve got lessons, we\'92ll get into trouble, and that\'92s \
nothing to what Hagrid \'92s going to be in when someone \
finds out what he\'92s doing \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Shut up!\'94 Harry whispered. \
\
Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped \
dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn\'92t \
like the look on Malfoy\'92s face at all. \
\
Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology \
and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to \
Hagrid\'92s with the other two during morning break. \
When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of \
their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels \
at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge \
of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed \
and excited. \
\
\'93It\'92s nearly out.\'94 He ushered them inside. \
\
The egg was lying on the table. There were deep \
cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny \
clicking noise was coming from it. \
\
They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched \
with bated breath. \
\
\
\
Page | 263 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg \
split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It \
wasn\'92t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a \
crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge \
compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout \
with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, \
orange eyes. \
\
It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout. \
\
\'93Isn\'92t he beautiful?\'94 Hagrid murmured. He reached \
out a hand to stroke the dragon\'92s head. It snapped at \
his fingers, showing pointed fangs. \
\
\'93Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!\'94 said Hagrid. \
\
\'93Hagrid,\'94 said Hermione, \'93how fast do Norwegian \
Ridgebacks grow, exactly?\'94 \
\
Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly \
drained from his face \'97 he leapt to his feet and ran to \
the window. \
\
\'93What\'92s the matter?\'94 \
\
\'93Someone was lookin\'92 through the gap in the curtains \
\'97 it\'92s a kid \'97 he\'92s runnin\'92 back up ter the school.\'94 \
\
Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a \
distance there was no mistaking him. \
\
Malfoy had seen the dragon. \
\
Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy\'92s face \
during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione \
very nervous. They spent most of their free time in \
Hagrid \'92s darkened hut, trying to reason with him. \
\
\'93Just let him go,\'94 Harry urged. \'93Set him free.\'94 \
\
Page | 264 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93I can\'92t,\'94 said Hagrid. \'93He\'92s too little. He\'92d die.\'94 \
\
\
\
They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times \
in length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its \
nostrils. Hagrid hadn\'92t been doing his gamekeeping \
duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. \
There were empty brandy bottles and chicken \
feathers all over the floor. \
\
\'93I\'92ve decided to call him Norbert,\'94 said Hagrid, looking \
at the dragon with misty eyes. \'93He really knows me \
now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where\'92s Mommy?\'94 \
\
\'93He\'92s lost his marbles,\'94 Ron muttered in Harry\'92s ear. \
\
\'93Hagrid,\'94 said Harry loudly, \'93give it two weeks and \
Norbert\'92s going to be as long as your house. Malfoy \
could go to Dumbledore at any moment.\'94 \
\
Hagrid bit his lip. \
\
\'93I \'97 I know I can\'92t keep him forever, but I can\'92t jus\'92 \
dump him, can\'92t.\'94 \
\
Harry suddenly turned to Ron. \
\
\'93Charlie,\'94 he said. \
\
\'93You\'92re losing it, too,\'94 said Ron. \'93I\'92m Ron, remember?\'94 \
\
\'93No \'97 Charlie \'97 your brother, Charlie. In Romania. \
Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to him. \
Charlie can take care of him and then put him back \
in the wild!\'94 \
\
\'93Brilliant!\'94 said Ron. \'93How about it, Hagrid?\'94 \
\
And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send \
an owl to Charlie to ask him. \
\
Page | 265 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
The following week dragged by. Wednesday night \
found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the \
common room, long after everyone else had gone to \
bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight \
when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out \
of nowhere as he pulled off Harry\'92s Invisibility Cloak. \
He had been down at Hagrid\'92s hut, helping him feed \
Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate. \
\
\'93It bit me!\'94 he said, showing them his hand, which \
was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. \'93I\'92m not going \
to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that \
dragon\'92s the most horrible animal I\'92ve ever met, but \
the way Hagrid goes on about it, you\'92d think it was a \
fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off \
for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a \
lullaby.\'94 \
\
There was a tap on the dark window. \
\
\'93It\'92s Hedwig!\'94 said Harry, hurrying to let her in. \'93She\'92ll \
have Charlie\'92s answer!\'94 \
\
The three of them put their heads together to read the \
note. \
\
Dear Ron, \
\
How are you? Thanks for the letter \'97 I\'92d be glad to \
take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won\'92t be easy \
getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send \
him over with some friends of mine who are coming to \
visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn\'92t be seen \
carrying an illegal dragon. \
\
Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at \
midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and \
take him away while it\'92s still dark. \
\
\
\
Page | 266 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Send me an answer as soon as possible. \
\
\
\
Love, \
\
Charlie \
\
They looked at one another. \
\
\'93We\'92ve got the Invisibility Cloak,\'94 said Harry. \'93It \
shouldn\'92t be too difficult \'97 I think the cloak\'92s big \
enough to cover two of us and Norbert.\'94 \
\
It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that \
the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of \
Norbert \'97 and Malfoy. \
\
There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron\'92s bitten \
hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn\'92t \
know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey \'97 \
would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, \
though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty \
shade of green. It looked as if Norbert\'92s fangs were \
poisonous. \
\
Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing \
at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in \
bed. \
\
\'93It\'92s not just my hand,\'94 he whispered, \'93although that \
feels like it\'92s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam \
Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he \
could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept \
threatening to tell her what really bit me \'97 I\'92ve told \
her it was a dog, but I don\'92t think she believes me \'97 I \
shouldn\'92t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that\'92s \
why he\'92s doing this.\'94 \
\
Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down. \
\
Page | 267 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93It\'92ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,\'94 said \
Hermione, but this didn\'92t soothe Ron at all. On the \
contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat. \
\
\'93Midnight on Saturday!\'94 he said in a hoarse voice. \
\
\'93Oh no \'97 oh no \'97 I\'92ve just remembered \'97 Charlie\'92s \
letter was in that book Malfoy took, he\'92s going to \
know we\'92re getting rid of Norbert.\'94 \
\
Harry and Hermione didn\'92t get a chance to answer. \
Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made \
them leave, saying Ron needed sleep. \
\
\'93It\'92s too late to change the plan now,\'94 Harry told \
Hermione. \'93We haven\'92t got time to send Charlie \
another owl, and this could be our only chance to get \
rid of Norbert. We\'92ll have to risk it. And we have got \
the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn\'92t know about \
that.\'94 \
\
They found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a \
bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who \
opened a window to talk to them. \
\
\'93I won\'92t let you in,\'94 he puffed. \'93Norbert\'92s at a tricky \
stage \'97 nothin\'92 I can\'92t handle.\'94 \
\
When they told him about Charlie\'92s letter, his eyes \
filled with tears, although that might have been \
because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg. \
\
\'93Aargh! It\'92s all right, he only got my boot \'97 jus\'92 \
playin\'92 \'97 he\'92s only a baby, after all.\'94 \
\
The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the \
windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to \
the castle feeling Saturday couldn\'92t come quickly \
enough. \
\
\
\
Page | 268 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time \
came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn\'92t \
been so worried about what they had to do. It was a \
very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late \
arriving at Hagrid \'92s hut because they\'92d had to wait for \
Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, \
where he\'92d been playing tennis against the wall. \
\
Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate. \
\
\'93He\'92s got lots o\'92 rats an\'92 some brandy fer the journey,\'94 \
said Hagrid in a muffled voice. \'93An\'92 I\'92ve packed his \
teddy bear in case he gets lonely.\'94 \
\
From inside the crate came ripping noises that \
sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his \
head torn off. \
\
\'93Bye-bye, Norbert!\'94 Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and \
Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak \
and stepped underneath it themselves. \'93Mommy will \
never forget you!\'94 \
\
How they managed to get the crate back up to the \
castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as \
they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the \
entrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up \
another staircase, then another \'97 even one of Harry\'92s \
shortcuts didn\'92t make the work much easier. \
\
\'93Nearly there!\'94 Harry panted as they reached the \
corridor beneath the tallest tower. \
\
Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them \
almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were \
already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, \
staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling \
with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared. \
\
\
\
Page | 269 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair \
net, had Malfoy by the ear. \
\
\
\
\'93Detention!\'94 she shouted. \'93And twenty points from \
Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the \
night, how dare you \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93You don\'92t understand, Professor. Harry Potter\'92s \
coming \'97 he\'92s got a dragon!\'94 \
\
\'93What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! \
Come on \'97 I shall see Professor Snape about you, \
Malfoy!\'94 \
\
The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower \
seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not \
until they\'92d stepped out into the cold night air did \
they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe \
properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig. \
\
\'93Malfoy\'92s got detention! I could sing!\'94 \
\
\'93Don\'92t,\'94 Harry advised her. \
\
Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert \
thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, \
four broomsticks came swooping down out of the \
darkness. \
\
Charlie\'92s friends were a cheery lot. They showed \
Harry and Hermione the harness they\'92d rigged up, so \
they could suspend Norbert between them. They all \
helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry \
and Hermione shook hands with the others and \
thanked them very much. \
\
At last, Norbert was going ... going ... gone. \
\
\
\
Page | 270 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their \
hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was \
off them. No more dragon \'97 Malfoy in detention \'97 \
what could spoil their happiness? \
\
The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the \
stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch\'92s face \
loomed suddenly out of the darkness. \
\
\'93Well, well, well,\'94 he whispered, \'93we are in trouble.\'94 \
\
They\'92d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower. \
\
\
\

\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
THE FORBIDDEN FOREST \
\
Things couldn\'92t have been worse. \
\
Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall\'92s \
study on the first floor, where they sat and waited \
without saying a word to each other. Hermione was \
trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories \
chased each other around Harry\'92s brain, each more \
feeble than the last. He couldn\'92t see how they were \
going to get out of trouble this time. They were \
cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to \
forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that \
Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out \
of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of \
night, let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower, \
which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add \
Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as \
well be packing their bags already. \
\
Had Harry thought that things couldn\'92t have been \
worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall \
appeared, she was leading Neville. \
\
\
\
Page | 272 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\'93Harry!\'94 Neville burst out, the moment he saw the \
other two. \'93I was trying to find you to warn you, I \
heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he \
said you had a drag \'97 \'94 \
\
Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but \
Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more \
likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over \
the three of them. \
\
\'93I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch \
says you were up in the Astronomy Tower. It\'92s one \
o\'92clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.\'94 \
\
It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to \
answer a teacher\'92s question. She was staring at her \
slippers, as still as a statue. \
\
\'93I think I\'92ve got a good idea of what\'92s been going on,\'94 \
said Professor McGonagall. \'93It doesn\'92t take a genius \
to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and- \
bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed \
and into trouble. I\'92ve already caught him. I suppose \
you think it\'92s funny that Longbottom here heard the \
story and believed it, too?\'94 \
\
Harry caught Neville\'92s eye and tried to tell him \
without words that this wasn\'92t true, because Neville \
was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering \
Neville \'97 Harry knew what it must have cost him to \
try and find them in the dark, to warn them. \
\
\'93I\'92m disgusted,\'94 said Professor McGonagall. \'93Four \
students out of bed in one night! I\'92ve never heard of \
such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you \
had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought \
Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of \
you will receive detentions \'97 yes, you too, Mr. \
Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk \
Page | 273 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
around school at night, especially these days, it\'92s very \
dangerous \'97 and fifty points will be taken from \
Gryffindor.\'94 \
\
\'93Fifty?\'94 Harry gasped \'97 they would lose the lead, the \
lead he\'92d won in the last Quidditch match. \
\
\'93Fifty points each,\'94 said Professor McGonagall, \
breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose. \
\
\'93Professor \'97 please \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93You can\'92t\'97\'94 \
\
\'93Don\'92t tell me what I can and can\'92t do, Potter. Now get \
back to bed, all of you. I\'92ve never been more ashamed \
of Gryffindor students.\'94 \
\
A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in \
last place. In one night, they\'92d ruined any chance \
Gryffindor had had for the House Cup. Harry felt as \
though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. \
How could they ever make up for this? \
\
Harry didn\'92t sleep all night. He could hear Neville \
sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. \
Harry couldn\'92t think of anything to say to comfort \
him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the \
dawn. What would happen when the rest of \
Gryffindor found out what they\'92d done? \
\
At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses \
that recorded the House points the next day thought \
there \'92d been a mistake. How could they suddenly \
have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? \
And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, \
the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch \
matches, had lost them all those points, him and a \
couple of other stupid first years. \
\
Page | 274 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
From being one of the most popular and admired \
people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most \
hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on \
him, because everyone had been longing to see \
Slytherin lose the House Cup. Everywhere Harry \
went, people pointed and didn\'92t trouble to lower their \
voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other \
hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and \
cheering, \'93Thanks Potter, we owe you one!\'94 \
\
Only Ron stood by him. \
\
\'93They\'92ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George \
have lost loads of points in all the time they\'92ve been \
here, and people still like them.\'94 \
\
\'93They\'92ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one \
go, though, have they?\'94 said Harry miserably. \
\
\'93Well \'97 no,\'94 Ron admitted. \
\
It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry \
swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren\'92t \
his business from now on. He\'92d had it with sneaking \
around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that \
he went to Wood and offered to resign from the \
Quidditch team. \
\
\'93Resign?\'94 Wood thundered. \'93What good\'92ll that do? \
\
How are we going to get any points back if we can\'92t \
win at Quidditch?\'94 \
\
But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the \
team wouldn\'92t speak to Harry during practice, and if \
they had to speak about him, they called him \'93the \
Seeker.\'94 \
\
Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn\'92t \
have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren\'92t as \
\

\
\
\
\
well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. \
Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in \
class, keeping her head down and working in silence. \
\
Harry was almost glad that the exams weren\'92t far \
away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off \
his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to \
themselves, working late into the night, trying to \
remember the ingredients in complicated potions, \
learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates \
of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions. ... \
\
Then, about a week before the exams were due to \
start, Harry\'92s new resolution not to interfere in \
anything that didn\'92t concern him was put to an \
unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his \
own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering \
from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he \
heard Quirrell\'92s voice. \
\
\'93No \'97 no \'97 not again, please \'97 \'94 \
\
It sounded as though someone was threatening him. \
Harry moved closer. \
\
\'93All right \'97 all right \'97 \'94 he heard Quirrell sob. \
\
Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the \
classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and \
looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out \
of sight; Harry didn\'92t think Quirrell had even noticed \
him. He waited until Quirrell\'92s footsteps had \
disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was \
empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry \
was halfway toward it before he remembered what \
he\'92d promised himself about not meddling. \
\
All the same, he\'92d have gambled twelve Sorcerer\'92s \
Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from \
\
Page | 276 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking \
with a new spring in his step \'97 Quirrell seemed to \
have given in at last. \
\
Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was \
testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he\'92d \
heard. \
\
\'93Snape\'92s done it, then!\'94 said Ron. \'93If Quirrell\'92s told \
him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93There\'92s still Fluffy, though,\'94 said Hermione. \
\
\'93Maybe Snape\'92s found out how to get past him \
without asking Hagrid,\'94 said Ron, looking up at the \
thousands of books surrounding them. \'93I bet there\'92s a \
book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a \
giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?\'94 \
\
The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron\'92s \
eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could. \
\
\'93Go to Dumbledore. That\'92s what we should have done \
ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we\'92ll be thrown \
out for sure.\'94 \
\
\'93But we\'92ve got no proof.\'94 said Harry. \'93Quirrell\'92s too \
scared to back us up. Snape\'92s only got to say he \
doesn\'92t know how the troll got in at Halloween and \
that he was nowhere near the third floor \'97 who do \
you think they\'92ll believe, him or us? It\'92s not exactly a \
secret we hate him, Dumbledore \'92ll think we made it \
up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn\'92t help us if his life \
depended on it, he\'92s too friendly with Snape, and the \
more students get thrown out, the better, he\'92ll think. \
And don\'92t forget, we\'92re not supposed to know about \
the Stone or Fluffy. That\'92ll take a lot of explaining.\'94 \
\
Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn\'92t. \
\
Page | 277 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93If we just do a bit of poking around \'97 \'94 \
\
\
\
\'93No,\'94 said Harry flatly, \'93we\'92ve done enough poking \
around.\'94 \
\
He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to \
learn the names of its moons. \
\
The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, \
Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They \
were all the same: \
\
Your detention will take place at eleven o\'92clock \
tonight. \
\
Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall. \
\
Professor M. McGonagall \
\
Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in \
the furor over the points they\'92d lost. He half expected \
Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of \
studying lost, but she didn\'92t say a word. Like Harry, \
she felt they deserved what they\'92d got. \
\
At eleven o\'92clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron \
in the common room and went down to the entrance \
hall with Neville. Filch was already there \'97 and so \
was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had \
gotten a detention, too. \
\
\'93Follow me,\'94 said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading \
them outside. \
\
\'93I bet you\'92ll think twice about breaking a school rule \
again, won\'92t you, eh?\'94 he said, leering at them. \'93Oh \
yes . . . hard work and pain are the best teachers if you \
ask me. ... It\'92s just a pity they let the old \
punishments die out . . . hang you by your wrists from \
Page | 278 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
the ceiling for a few days, I\'92ve got the chains still in \
my office, keep \'92em well oiled in case they\'92re ever \
needed. ... Right, off we go, and don\'92t think of running \
off, now, it\'92ll be worse for you if you do.\'94 \
\
They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville \
kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment \
was going to be. It must be something really horrible, \
or Filch wouldn\'92t be sounding so delighted. \
\
The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it \
kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry \
could see the lighted windows of Hagrid\'92s hut. Then \
they heard a distant shout. \
\
\'93Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.\'94 \
\
Harry\'92s heart rose; if they were going to be working \
with Hagrid it wouldn\'92t be so bad. His relief must \
have showed in his face, because Filch said, \'93I \
suppose you think you\'92ll be enjoying yourself with \
that oaf? Well, think again, boy \'97 it\'92s into the forest \
you\'92re going and I\'92m much mistaken if you\'92ll all come \
out in one piece.\'94 \
\
At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy \
stopped dead in his tracks. \
\
\'93The forest?\'94 he repeated, and he didn\'92t sound quite \
as cool as usual. \'93We can\'92t go in there at night \'97 \
there\'92s all sorts of things in there \'97 werewolves, I \
heard.\'94 \
\
Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry\'92s robe and made a \
choking noise. \
\
\'93That\'92s your problem, isn\'92t it?\'94 said Filch, his voice \
cracking with glee. \'93Should\'92ve thought of them \
werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn\'92t you?\'94 \
\
Page | 279 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, \
Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, \
and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder. \
\
\'93Abou\'92 time,\'94 he said. \'93I bin waitin\'92 fer half an hour \
already. All right, Harry, Hermione?\'94 \
\
\'93I shouldn\'92t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,\'94 said \
Filch coldly, \'93they\'92re here to be punished, after all.\'94 \
\
\'93That\'92s why yer late, is it?\'94 said Hagrid, frowning at \
Filch. \'93Bin lecturin\'92 them, eh? \'92Snot your place ter do \
that. Yeh\'92ve done yer bit, I\'92ll take over from here.\'94 \
\
\'93I\'92ll be back at dawn,\'94 said Filch, \'93for what\'92s left of \
them,\'94 he added nastily, and he turned and started \
back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the \
darkness. \
\
Malfoy now turned to Hagrid. \
\
\'93I\'92m not going in that forest,\'94 he said, and Harry was \
pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice. \
\
\'93Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,\'94 said \
Hagrid fiercely. \'93Yeh\'92ve done wrong an\'92 now yeh\'92ve got \
ter pay fer it.\'94 \
\
\'93But this is servant stuff, it\'92s not for students to do. I \
thought we\'92d be copying lines or something, if my \
father knew I was doing this, he\'92d \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93 \'97 tell yer that\'92s how it is at Hogwarts,\'94 Hagrid \
growled. \'93Copyin\'92 lines! What good\'92s that ter anyone? \
Yeh\'92ll do summat useful or yeh\'92ll get out. If yeh think \
yer father\'92d rather you were expelled, then get back \
off ter the castle an\'92 pack. Go on!\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 280 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Malfoy didn\'92t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but \
then dropped his gaze. \
\
\'93Right then,\'94 said Hagrid, \'93now, listen carefully, \
\
\'92cause it\'92s dangerous what we\'92re gonna do tonight, an\'92 \
I don\'92 want no one takin\'92 risks. Follow me over here a \
moment.\'94 \
\
He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his \
lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding \
earth track that disappeared into the thick black \
trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked \
into the forest. \
\
\'93Look there,\'94 said Hagrid, \'93see that stuff shinin\'92 on \
the ground? Silvery stuff? That\'92s unicorn blood. \
There\'92s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. \
This is the second time in a week. I found one dead \
last Wednesday. We\'92re gonna try an\'92 find the poor \
thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.\'94 \
\
\'93And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us \
first?\'94 said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his \
voice. \
\
\'93There\'92s nothin\'92 that lives in the forest that\'92ll hurt yeh \
if yer with me or Fang,\'94 said Hagrid. \'93An\'92 keep ter the \
path. Right, now, we\'92re gonna split inter two parties \
an\'92 follow the trail in diff\'92rent directions. There\'92s blood \
all over the place, it must\'92ve bin staggerin\'92 around \
since last night at least.\'94 \
\
\'93I want Fang,\'94 said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang\'92s \
long teeth. \
\
\'93All right, but I warn yeh, he\'92s a coward,\'94 said Hagrid. \
\'93So me, Harry, an\'92 Hermione\'92ll go one way an\'92 Draco, \
Neville, an\'92 Fang\'92ll go the other. Now, if any of us \
finds the unicorn, we\'92ll send up green sparks, right? \
\
Page | 281 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Get yer wands out an\'92 practice now \'97 that\'92s it \'97 an\'92 \
if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an\'92 we\'92ll \
all come an\'92 find yeh \'97 so, be careful \'97 let\'92s go.\'94 \
\
The forest was black and silent. A little way into it \
they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, \
Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, \
Neville, and Fang took the right. \
\
They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. \
Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the \
branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the \
fallen leaves. \
\
Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried. \
\
\'93 Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?\'94 Harry \
asked. \
\
\'93Not fast enough,\'94 said Hagrid. \'93It\'92s not easy ter catch \
a unicorn, they\'92re powerful magic creatures. I never \
knew one ter be hurt before.\'94 \
\
They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could \
hear running water; there must be a stream \
somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn \
blood here and there along the winding path. \
\
\'93You all right, Hermione?\'94 Hagrid whispered. \'93Don\'92 \
worry, it can\'92t\'92ve gone far if it\'92s this badly hurt, an\'92 \
then well be able ter \'97 GET BEHIND THAT TREE!\'94 \
\
Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them \
off the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an \
arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready \
to fire. The three of them listened. Something was \
slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a \
cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting \
\
\
\
Page | 282 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound \
faded away. \
\
\'93I knew it,\'94 he murmured. \'93There\'92s summat in here \
that shouldn\'92 be.\'94 \
\
\'93A werewolf?\'94 Harry suggested. \
\
\'93That wasn\'92 no werewolf an\'92 it wasn\'92 no unicorn, \
neither,\'94 said Hagrid grimly. \'93Right, follow me, but \
careful, now.\'94 \
\
They walked more slowly, ears straining for the \
faintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, \
something definitely moved. \
\
\'93Who\'92s there?\'94 Hagrid called. \'93Show yerself \'97 I\'92m \
armed!\'94 \
\
And into the clearing came \'97 was it a man, or a \
horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, \
but below that was a horse\'92s gleaming chestnut body \
with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione\'92s jaws \
dropped. \
\
\'93Oh, it\'92s you, Ronan,\'94 said Hagrid in relief. \'93How are \
yeh?\'94 \
\
He walked forward and shook the centaur\'92s hand. \
\
\'93Good evening to you, Hagrid,\'94 said Ronan. He had a \
deep, sorrowful voice. \'93Were you going to shoot me?\'94 \
\
\'93Can\'92t be too careful, Ronan,\'94 said Hagrid, patting his \
crossbow. \'93There\'92s summat bad loose in this forest. \
This is Harry Potter an\'92 Hermione Granger, by the \
way. Students up at the school. An\'92 this is Ronan, \
you two. He\'92s a centaur.\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 283 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93We\'92d noticed,\'94 said Hermione faintly. \
\
\
\
\'93Good evening,\'94 said Ronan. \'93Students, are you? And \
do you learn much, up at the school?\'94 \
\
\'93Erm \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93A bit,\'94 said Hermione timidly. \
\
\'93A bit. Well, that\'92s something.\'94 Ronan sighed. He \
flung back his head and stared at the sky. \'93Mars is \
bright tonight.\'94 \
\
\'93Yeah,\'94 said Hagrid, glancing up, too. \'93Listen, I\'92m glad \
we\'92ve run inter yeh, Ronan, \'92cause there\'92s a unicorn \
bin hurt \'97 you seen anythin\'92?\'94 \
\
Ronan didn\'92t answer immediately. He stared \
unblinkingly upward, then sighed again. \
\
\'93Always the innocent are the first victims,\'94 he said. \
\
\'93So it has been for ages past, so it is now.\'94 \
\
\'93Yeah,\'94 said Hagrid, \'93but have yeh seen anythin\'92, \
Ronan? Anythin\'92 unusual?\'94 \
\
\'93Mars is bright tonight,\'94 Ronan repeated, while \
Hagrid watched him impatiently. \'93Unusually bright.\'94 \
\
\'93Yeah, but I was meanin\'92 anythin\'92 unusual a bit \
nearer home,\'94 said Hagrid. \'93So yeh haven\'92t noticed \
anythin\'92 strange?\'94 \
\
Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he \
said, \'93The forest hides many secrets.\'94 \
\
A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid \
raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, \
\
Page | 284 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than \
Ronan. \
\
\
\
\'93Hullo, Bane,\'94 said Hagrid. \'93All right?\'94 \
\
\'93Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?\'94 \
\
\'93Well enough. Look, I\'92ve jus\'92 bin askin\'92 Ronan, you \
seen anythin\'92 odd in here lately? There\'92s a unicorn \
bin injured \'97 would yeh know anythin\'92 about it?\'94 \
\
Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked \
skyward. \
\
\'93Mars is bright tonight,\'94 he said simply. \
\
\'93We\'92ve heard,\'94 said Hagrid grumpily. \'93Well, if either of \
you do see anythin\'92, let me know, won\'92t yeh? We\'92ll be \
off, then.\'94 \
\
Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, \
staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until \
the trees blocked their view. \
\
\'93Never,\'94 said Hagrid irritably, \'93try an\'92 get a straight \
answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not \
interested in anythin\'92 closer\'92n the moon.\'94 \
\
\'93Are there many of them in here?\'94 asked Hermione. \
\
\'93Oh, a fair few. . . . Keep themselves to themselves \
mostly, but they\'92re good enough about turnin\'92 up if \
ever I want a word. They\'92re deep, mind, centaurs ... \
they know things ... jus\'92 don\'92 let on much.\'94 \
\
\'93D\'92you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?\'94 \
said Harry. \
\
\
\
Page | 285 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask \
me, that was what\'92s bin killin\'92 the unicorns \'97 never \
heard anythin\'92 like it before.\'94 \
\
They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry \
kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the \
nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very \
glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. \
They had just passed a bend in the path when \
Hermione grabbed Hagrid \'92s arm. \
\
\'93Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!\'94 \
\
\'93You two wait here!\'94 Hagrid shouted. \'93Stay on the \
path, I\'92ll come back for yeh!\'94 \
\
They heard him crashing away through the \
undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very \
scared, until they couldn\'92t hear anything but the \
rustling of leaves around them. \
\
\'93You don\'92t think they\'92ve been hurt, do you?\'94 \
whispered Hermione. \
\
\'93I don\'92t care if Malfoy has, but if something\'92s got \
Neville ... it\'92s our fault he\'92s here in the first place.\'94 \
\
The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper \
than usual. Harry\'92s seemed to be picking up every \
sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going \
on? Where were the others? \
\
At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid\'92s \
return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. \
Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked \
up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville \
had panicked and sent up the sparks. \
\
\
\
Page | 286 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Well be lucky ter catch anythin\'92 now, with the racket \
you two were makin\'92. Right, we\'92re changin\'92 groups \'97 \
Neville, you stay with me an\'92 Hermione, Harry, you go \
with Fang an\'92 this idiot. I\'92m sorry,\'94 Hagrid added in a \
whisper to Harry, \'93but he\'92ll have a harder time \
frightenin\'92 you, an\'92 we\'92ve gotta get this done.\'94 \
\
So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with \
Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an \
hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path \
became almost impossible to follow because the trees \
were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be \
getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a \
tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing \
around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing \
ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient \
oak. \
\
\'93Look \'97 \'94 he murmured, holding out his arm to stop \
Malfoy. \
\
Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. \
They inched closer. \
\
It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry \
had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its \
long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where \
it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on \
the dark leaves. \
\
Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering \
sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on \
the edge of the clearing quivered. ... Then, out of the \
shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the \
ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and \
Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the \
unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the \
animals side, and began to drink its blood. \
\
\
\
Page | 287 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93AAAAAAAAAAARGH ! \'94 \
\
\
\
Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted \'97 so did \
Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked \
right at Harry \'97 unicorn blood was dribbling down its \
front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry \
\'97 he couldn\'92t move for fear. \
\
Then a pain like he\'92d never felt before pierced his \
head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half \
blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves \
behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean \
over Harry, charging at the figure. \
\
The pain in Harry\'92s head was so bad he fell to his \
knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he \
looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was \
standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one \
looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a \
palomino body. \
\
\'93Are you all right?\'94 said the centaur, pulling Harry to \
his feet. \
\
\'93Yes \'97 thank you \'97 what was that?\'94 \
\
The centaur didn\'92t answer. He had astonishingly blue \
eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at \
Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, \
livid, on Harry\'92s forehead. \
\
\'93You are the Potter boy,\'94 he said. \'93You had better get \
back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time \'97 \
especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker \
this way. \
\
\'93My name is Firenze,\'94 he added, as he lowered \
himself on to his front legs so that Harry could \
clamber onto his back. \
\
Page | 288 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from \
the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came \
bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and \
sweaty. \
\
\'93Firenze!\'94 Bane thundered. \'93What are you doing? You \
have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are \
you a common mule?\'94 \
\
\'93Do you realize who this is?\'94 said Firenze. \'93This is the \
Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the \
better.\'94 \
\
\'93What have you been telling him?\'94 growled Bane. \
\'93Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set \
ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what \
is to come in the movements of the planets?\'94 \
\
Ronan pawed the ground nervously. \'93I\'92m sure Firenze \
thought he was acting for the best,\'94 he said in his \
gloomy voice. \
\
Bane kicked his back legs in anger. \
\
\'93For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs \
are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not \
our business to run around like donkeys after stray \
humans in our forest!\'94 \
\
Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, \
so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on. \
\
\'93Do you not see that unicorn?\'94 Firenze bellowed at \
Bane. \'93Do you not understand why it was killed? Or \
have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set \
myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, \
yes, with humans alongside me if I must.\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 289 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on \
as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, \
leaving Ronan and Bane behind them. \
\
Harry didn\'92t have a clue what was going on. \
\
\'93Why\'92s Bane so angry?\'94 he asked. \'93What was that \
thing you saved me from, anyway?\'94 \
\
Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his \
head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did \
not answer Harry\'92s question. They made their way \
through the trees in silence for so long that Harry \
thought Firenze didn\'92t want to talk to him anymore. \
They were passing through a particularly dense patch \
of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped. \
\
\'93Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is \
used for?\'94 \
\
\'93No,\'94 said Harry, startled by the odd question. \'93We\'92ve \
only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.\'94 \
\
\'93That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a \
unicorn,\'94 said Firenze. \'93Only one who has nothing to \
lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a \
crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even \
if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. \
You have slain something pure and defenseless to \
save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a \
cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your \
lips.\'94 \
\
Harry stared at the back of Firenze\'92s head, which was \
dappled silver in the moonlight. \
\
\'93But who\'92d be that desperate?\'94 he wondered aloud. \'93If \
you\'92re going to be cursed forever, death\'92s better, isn\'92t \
it?\'94 \
\
Page | 290 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93It is,\'94 Firenze agreed, \'93unless all you need is to stay \
alive long enough to drink something else \'97 \
something that will bring you back to full strength \
and power \'97 something that will mean you can never \
die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the \
school at this very moment?\'94 \
\
\'93The Sorcerer\'92s Stone! Of course \'97 the Elixir of Life! \
But I don\'92t understand who \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Can you think of nobody who has waited many years \
to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting \
their chance?\'94 \
\
It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly \
around Harry\'92s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, \
he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told \
him on the night they had met: \'93Some say he died. \
Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough \
human left in him to die.\'94 \
\
\'93Do you mean,\'94 Harry croaked, \'93that was VoZ \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Harry! Harry, are you all right?\'94 \
\
Hermione was running toward them down the path, \
Hagrid puffing along behind her. \
\
\'93I\'92m fine,\'94 said Harry, hardly knowing what he was \
saying. \'93The unicorn\'92s dead, Hagrid, it\'92s in that \
clearing back there.\'94 \
\
\'93This is where I leave you,\'94 Firenze murmured as \
Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. \'93You are \
safe now.\'94 \
\
Harry slid off his back. \
\
\
\
Page | 291 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Good luck, Harry Potter,\'94 said Firenze. \'93The planets \
have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. \
I hope this is one of those times.\'94 \
\
He turned and cantered back into the depths of the \
forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him. \
\
Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, \
waiting for them to return. He shouted something \
about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him \
awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide- \
eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what \
had happened in the forest. \
\
Harry couldn\'92t sit down. He paced up and down in \
front of the fire. He was still shaking. \
\
\'93Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort ... and \
Voldemort\'92s waiting in the forest ... and all this time \
we thought Snape just wanted to get rich. ...\'94 \
\
\'93Stop saying the name!\'94 said Ron in a terrified \
whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them. \
\
Harry wasn\'92t listening. \
\
\'93Firenze saved me, but he shouldn\'92t have done so. ... \
Bane was furious ... he was talking about interfering \
with what the planets say is going to happen. ... They \
must show that Voldemort\'92s coming back. ... Bane \
thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me. ... I \
suppose that\'92s written in the stars as well.\'94 \
\
\'93Will you stop saying the name\\\'94 Ron hissed. \
\
\'93So all I\'92ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the \
Stone,\'94 Harry went on feverishly, \'93then Voldemort will \
be able to come and finish me off. ... Well, I suppose \
Bane 11 be happy.\'94 \
\

\
\
\
\
Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word \
of comfort. \
\
\'93Harry, everyone says Dumbledore\'92s the only one \
You-Know-Who was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore \
around, You-Know-Who won\'92t touch you. Anyway, \
who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like \
fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says \
that\'92s a very imprecise branch of magic.\'94 \
\
The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. \
They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But \
the night\'92s surprises weren\'92t over. \
\
When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his \
Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them. \
There was a note pinned to it: \
\
Just in case. \
\
\

\
\
THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR \
\
In years to come, Harry would never quite remember \
how he had managed to get through his exams when \
he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through \
the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and \
there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and \
well behind the locked door. \
\
It was sweltering hot, especially in the large \
classroom where they did their written papers. They \
had been given special, new quills for the exams, \
which had been bewitched with an Anti-Cheating \
spell. \
\
They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick \
called them one by one into his class to see if they \
could make a pineapple tap-dance across a desk. \
Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse \
into a snuffbox \'97 points were given for how pretty the \
snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. \
Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their \
necks while they tried to remember how to make a \
Forgetfulness potion. \
\
Page | 294 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the \
stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been \
bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. \
Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves \
because Harry couldn\'92t sleep, but the truth was that \
Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except \
that it was now worse than ever because there was a \
hooded figure dripping blood in it. \
\
Maybe it was because they hadn\'92t seen what Harry \
had seen in the forest, or because they didn\'92t have \
scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and \
Hermione didn\'92t seem as worried about the Stone as \
Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, \
but he didn\'92t keep visiting them in dreams, and they \
were so busy with their studying they didn\'92t have \
much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else \
might be up to. \
\
Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour \
of answering questions about batty old wizards who\'92d \
invented self-stirring cauldrons and they\'92d be free, \
free for a whole wonderful week until their exam \
results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns \
told them to put down their quills and roll up their \
parchment, Harry couldn\'92t help cheering with the \
rest. \
\
\'93That was far easier than I thought it would be,\'94 said \
Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto \
the sunny grounds. \'93I needn\'92t have learned about the \
1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of \
Elfric the Eager.\'94 \
\
Hermione always liked to go through their exam \
papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, \
so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under \
a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were \
\
\
\
Page | 295 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was \
basking in the warm shallows. \
\
\
\
\'93No more studying,\'94 Ron sighed happily, stretching \
out on the grass. \'93You could look more cheerful, \
\
Harry, we\'92ve got a week before we find out how badly \
we\'92ve done, there\'92s no need to worry yet.\'94 \
\
Harry was rubbing his forehead. \
\
\'93I wish I knew what this means\\\'94 he burst out angrily. \
\'93My scar keeps hurting \'97 it\'92s happened before, but \
never as often as this.\'94 \
\
\'93Go to Madam Pomfrey,\'94 Hermione suggested. \
\
\'93I\'92m not ill,\'94 said Harry. \'93I think it\'92s a warning ... it \
means danger\'92s coming. ...\'94 \
\
Ron couldn\'92t get worked up, it was too hot. \
\
\'93Harry, relax, Hermione \'92s right, the Stone\'92s safe as \
long as Dumbledore\'92s around. Anyway, we\'92ve never \
had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. \
He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he\'92s not going to \
try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch \
for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\'94 \
\
Harry nodded, but he couldn\'92t shake off a lurking \
feeling that there was something he\'92d forgotten to do, \
something important. When he tried to explain this, \
Hermione said, \'93That\'92s just the exams. I woke up last \
night and was halfway through my Transfiguration \
notes before I remembered we\'92d done that one.\'94 \
\
Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn\'92t have \
anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl \
flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a \
note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one \
\
Page | 296 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray \
Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to \
get past Fluffy . . . never . . . but \'97 \
\
Harry suddenly jumped to his feet. \
\
\'93Where \'92re you going?\'94 said Ron sleepily. \
\
\'93I\'92ve just thought of something,\'94 said Harry. He had \
turned white. \'93We\'92ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.\'94 \
\
\'93Why?\'94 panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up. \
\
\'93Don\'92t you think it\'92s a bit odd,\'94 said Harry, \
scrambling up the grassy slope, \'93that what Hagrid \
wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a \
stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in \
his pocket? How many people wander around with \
dragon eggs if it\'92s against wizard law? Lucky they \
found Hagrid, don\'92t you think? Why didn\'92t I see it \
before?\'94 \
\
\'93What are you talking about?\'94 said Ron, but Harry, \
sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn\'92t \
answer. \
\
Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; \
his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was \
shelling peas into a large bowl. \
\
\'93Hullo,\'94 he said, smiling. \'93Finished yer exams? Got \
time fer a drink?\'94 \
\
\'93Yes, please,\'94 said Ron, but Harry cut him off. \
\
\'93No, we\'92re in a hurry. Hagrid, I\'92ve got to ask you \
something. You know that night you won Norbert? \
What did the stranger you were playing cards with \
look like?\'94 \
\
Page | 297 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Dunno said Hagrid casually, \'93he wouldn\'92 take his \
cloak off.\'94 \
\
\
\
He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his \
eyebrows. \
\
\'93It\'92s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o\'92 funny folk in \
the Hog\'92s Head \'97 that\'92s one o\'92 the pubs down in the \
village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn\'92 he? I \
never saw his face, he kept his hood up.\'94 \
\
Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. \
\
\'93What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you \
mention Hogwarts at all?\'94 \
\
\'93Mighta come up,\'94 said Hagrid, frowning as he tried \
to remember. \'93Yeah ... he asked what I did, an\'92 I told \
him I was gamekeeper here. ... He asked a bit about \
the sorta creatures I look after ... so I told him ... an\'92 I \
said what I\'92d always really wanted was a dragon ... \
an\'92 then ... I can\'92 remember too well, \'92cause he kept \
buyin\'92 me drinks. ... Let\'92s see ... yeah, then he said he \
had the dragon egg an\'92 we could play cards fer it if I \
wanted . . . but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he \
didn\'92 want it ter go ter any old home. ... So I told him, \
after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy. ...\'94 \
\
\'93And did he \'97 did he seem interested in Fluffy?\'94 \
\
Harry asked, trying to keep his voice calm. \
\
\'93Well \'97 yeah \'97 how many three-headed dogs d\'92yeh \
meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy\'92s a \
piece o\'92 cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus\'92 \
play him a bit o\'92 music an\'92 he\'92ll go straight off ter \
sleep \'97 \'94 \
\
Hagrid suddenly looked horrified. \
\
Page | 298 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93I shouldn\'92ta told yeh that!\'94 he blurted out. \'93Forget I \
said it! Hey \'97 where\'92re yeh goin\'92?\'94 \
\
Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn\'92t speak to each other \
at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, \
which seemed very cold and gloomy after the \
grounds. \
\
\'93We\'92ve got to go to Dumbledore,\'94 said Harry. \'93Hagrid \
told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was \
either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak \'97 it \
must\'92ve been easy, once he\'92d got Hagrid drunk. I just \
hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us \
up if Bane doesn\'92t stop him. Where\'92s Dumbledore\'92s \
office?\'94 \
\
They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign \
pointing them in the right direction. They had never \
been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know \
anyone who had been sent to see him. \
\
\'93Well just have to \'97 \'94 Harry began, but a voice \
suddenly rang across the hall. \
\
\'93What are you three doing inside?\'94 \
\
It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of \
books. \
\
\'93We want to see Professor Dumbledore,\'94 said \
Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought. \
\
\'93See Professor Dumbledore?\'94 Professor McGonagall \
repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to \
want to do. \'93Why?\'94 \
\
Harry swallowed \'97 now what? \
\
\
\
Page | 299 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93It\'92s sort of secret,\'94 he said, but he wished at once he \
hadn\'92t, because Professor McGonagall\'92s nostrils \
flared. \
\
\'93Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\'94 she said \
coldly. \'93He received an urgent owl from the Ministry \
of Magic and flew off for London at once.\'94 \
\
\'93He\'92s gone?\'94 said Harry frantically. \'93Now?\'94 \
\
\'93Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, \
he has many demands on his time \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93But this is important.\'94 \
\
\'93Something you have to say is more important than \
the Ministry of Magic, Potter?\'94 \
\
\'93Look,\'94 said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \
\'93Professor \'97 it\'92s about the Sorcerer\'92s Stone \'97 \'94 \
\
Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it \
wasn\'92t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out \
of her arms, but she didn\'92t pick them up. \
\
\'93How do you know \'97 ?\'94 she spluttered. \
\
\'93Professor, I think \'97 I know \'97 that Sn \'97 that \
someone\'92s going to try and steal the Stone. I\'92ve got to \
talk to Professor Dumbledore.\'94 \
\
She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion. \
\
\'93Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\'94 she \
said finally. \'93I don\'92t know how you found out about \
the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal \
it, it\'92s too well protected.\'94 \
\
\'93But Professor \'97 \'94 \
\
Page | 300 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Potter, I know what I\'92m talking about,\'94 she said \
shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen \
books. \'93I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy \
the sunshine.\'94 \
\
But they didn\'92t. \
\
\'93It\'92s tonight,\'94 said Harry, once he was sure Professor \
McGonagall was out of earshot. \'93Snape\'92s going \
through the trapdoor tonight. He\'92s found out \
everything he needs, and now he\'92s got Dumbledore \
out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of \
Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns \
up.\'94 \
\
\'93But what can we \'97 \'94 \
\
Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round. \
Snape was standing there. \
\
\'93Good afternoon,\'94 he said smoothly. \
\
They stared at him. \
\
\'93You shouldn\'92t be inside on a day like this,\'94 he said, \
with an odd, twisted smile. \
\
\'93We were \'97 \'94 Harry began, without any idea what he \
was going to say. \
\
\'93You want to be more careful,\'94 said Snape. \'93Hanging \
around like this, people will think you\'92re up to \
something. And Gryffindor really can\'92t afford to lose \
any more points, can it?\'94 \
\
Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape \
called them back. \
\
\
\
Page | 301 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Be warned, Potter \'97 any more nighttime wanderings \
and I will personally make sure you are expelled. \
\
Good day to you.\'94 \
\
He strode off in the direction of the staffroom. \
\
Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others. \
\
\'93Right, here\'92s what we\'92ve got to do,\'94 he whispered \
urgently. \'93One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape \
\'97 wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he \
leaves it. Hermione, you\'92d better do that.\'94 \
\
\'93Why me?\'94 \
\
\'93It\'92s obvious,\'94 said Ron. \'93You can pretend to be \
waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.\'94 He put on a \
high voice, \'93 \'91Oh Professor Flitwick, I\'92m so worried, I \
think I got question fourteen b wrong. . . . \'92 \'94 \
\
\'93Oh, shut up,\'94 said Hermione, but she agreed to go \
and watch out for Snape. \
\
\'93And we\'92d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,\'94 \
Harry told Ron. \'93Come on.\'94 \
\
But that part of the plan didn\'92t work. No sooner had \
they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest \
of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up \
again and this time, she lost her temper. \
\
\'93I suppose you think you\'92re harder to get past than a \
pack of enchantments!\'94 she stormed. \'93Enough of this \
nonsense! If I hear you\'92ve come anywhere near here \
again, I\'92ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! \
\
Yes, Weasley, from my own House!\'94 \
\
Harry and Ron went back to the common room. Harry \
had just said, \'93At least Hermione\'92s on Snape\'92s tail,\'94 \
\
Page | 302 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and \
Hermione came in. \
\
\'93I\'92m sorry, Harry!\'94 she wailed. \'93Snape came out and \
asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for \
Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I\'92ve only \
just got away, I don\'92t know where Snape went.\'94 \
\
\'93Well, that\'92s it then, isn\'92t it?\'94 Harry said. \
\
The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes \
were glittering. \
\
\'93I\'92m going out of here tonight and I\'92m going to try and \
get to the Stone first.\'94 \
\
\'93You\'92re mad!\'94 said Ron. \
\
\'93You can\'92t!\'94 said Hermione. \'93After what McGonagall \
and Snape have said? You\'92ll be expelled!\'94 \
\
\'93SO WHAT?\'94 Harry shouted. \'93Don\'92t you understand? \
If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort\'92s coming \
back! Haven\'92t you heard what it was like when he was \
trying to take over? There won\'92t be any Hogwarts to \
get expelled from! He\'92ll flatten it, or turn it into a \
school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn\'92t matter \
anymore, can\'92t you see? D\'92you think he\'92ll leave you \
and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the House \
Cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, \
I\'92ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for \
Voldemort to find me there, it\'92s only dying a bit later \
than I would have, because I\'92m never going over to \
the Dark Side! I\'92m going through that trapdoor \
tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! \
Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\'94 \
\
He glared at them. \
\
\
\
Page | 303 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93You\'92re right, Harry,\'94 said Hermione in a small voice. \
\
\
\
\'93I\'92ll use the Invisibility Cloak,\'94 said Harry. \'93It\'92s just \
lucky I got it back.\'94 \
\
\'93But will it cover all three of us?\'94 said Ron. \
\
\'93All \'97 all three of us?\'94 \
\
\'93Oh, come off it, you don\'92t think we\'92d let you go \
alone?\'94 \
\
\'93Of course not,\'94 said Hermione briskly. \'93How do you \
think you\'92d get to the Stone without us? I\'92d better go \
and look through my books, there might be \
something useful. ...\'94 \
\
\'93But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\'94 \
\
\'93Not if I can help it,\'94 said Hermione grimly. \'93Flitwick \
told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve \
percent on his exam. They\'92re not throwing me out \
after that.\'94 \
\
After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in \
the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of \
the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any \
more, after all. This was the first night he hadn\'92t been \
upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her \
notes, hoping to come across one of the \
enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry \
and Ron didn\'92t talk much. Both of them were \
thinking about what they were about to do. \
\
Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed. \
\
\'93Better get the cloak,\'94 Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan \
finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran \
upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the \
\
Page | 304 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had \
given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on \
Fluffy \'97 he didn\'92t feel much like singing. \
\
He ran back down to the common room. \
\
\'93We\'92d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it \
covers all three of us \'97 if Filch spots one of our feet \
wandering along on its own \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93What are you doing?\'94 said a voice from the corner of \
the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, \
clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he\'92d \
been making another bid for freedom. \
\
\'93Nothing, Neville, nothing,\'94 said Harry, hurriedly \
putting the cloak behind his back. \
\
Neville stared at their guilty faces. \
\
\'93You\'92re going out again,\'94 he said. \
\
\'93No, no, no,\'94 said Hermione. \'93No, we\'92re not. Why don\'92t \
you go to bed, Neville?\'94 \
\
Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. \
They couldn\'92t afford to waste any more time, Snape \
might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep. \
\
\'93You can\'92t go out,\'94 said Neville, \'93you\'92ll be caught \
again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.\'94 \
\
\'93You don\'92t understand,\'94 said Harry, \'93this is \
important.\'94 \
\
But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do \
something desperate. \
\
\
\

\
\
\
\
\'93I won\'92t let you do it,\'94 he said, hurrying to stand in \
front of the portrait hole. \'93I\'92ll \'97 I\'92ll fight you!\'94 \
\
\'93Neville,\'94 Ron exploded, \'93get away from that hole and \
don\'92t be an idiot \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Don\'92t you call me an idiot!\'94 said Neville. \'93I don\'92t \
think you should be breaking any more rules! And \
you were the one who told me to stand up to people!\'94 \
\
\'93Yes, but not to us,\'94 said Ron in exasperation. \
\
\'93Neville, you don\'92t know what you\'92re doing.\'94 \
\
He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the \
toad, who leapt out of sight. \
\
\'93Go on then, try and hit me!\'94 said Neville, raising his \
fists. \'93I\'92m ready!\'94 \
\
Harry turned to Hermione. \
\
\'93Do something,\'94 he said desperately. \
\
Hermione stepped forward. \
\
\'93Neville,\'94 she said, \'93I\'92m really, really sorry about this.\'94 \
She raised her wand. \
\
\'93Petrificus Totalusl\'94 she cried, pointing it at Neville. \
\
Neville\'92s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang \
together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he \
stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board. \
\
Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville\'92s jaws were \
jammed together so he couldn\'92t speak. Only his eyes \
were moving, looking at them in horror. \
\
\
\
Page | 306 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93What\'92ve you done to him?\'94 Harry whispered. \
\
\
\
\'93It\'92s the full Body-Bind,\'94 said Hermione miserably. \
\'93Oh, Neville, I\'92m so sorry.\'94 \
\
\'93We had to, Neville, no time to explain,\'94 said Harry. \
\
\'93You\'92ll understand later, Neville,\'94 said Ron as they \
stepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak. \
\
But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn\'92t \
feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, \
every statue\'92s shadow looked like Filch, every distant \
breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on \
them. \
\
At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. \
Norris skulking near the top. \
\
\'93Oh, let\'92s kick her, just this once,\'94 Ron whispered in \
Harry\'92s ear, but Harry shook his head. As they \
climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her \
lamplike eyes on them, but didn\'92t do anything. \
\
They didn\'92t meet anyone else until they reached the \
staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing \
halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would \
trip. \
\
\'93Who\'92s there?\'94 he said suddenly as they climbed \
toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. \
\'93Know you\'92re there, even if I can\'92t see you. Are you \
ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\'94 \
\
He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at \
them. \
\
\'93Should call Filch, I should, if something\'92s a-creeping \
around unseen.\'94 \
\
Page | 307 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Harry had a sudden idea. \
\
\
\
\'93Peeves,\'94 he said, in a hoarse whisper, \'93the Bloody \
Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.\'94 \
\
Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught \
himself in time and hovered about a foot off the \
stairs. \
\
\'93So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, sir,\'94 he said \
greasily. \'93My mistake, my mistake \'97 I didn\'92t see you \
\'97 of course I didn\'92t, you\'92re invisible \'97 forgive old \
Peevsie his little joke, sir.\'94 \
\
\'93I have business here, Peeves,\'94 croaked Harry. \'93Stay \
away from this place tonight.\'94 \
\
\'93I will, sir, I most certainly will,\'94 said Peeves, rising up \
in the air again. \'93Hope your business goes well, \
\
Baron, I\'92ll not bother you.\'94 \
\
And he scooted off. \
\
\'93Brilliant, Harry!\'94 whispered Ron. \
\
A few seconds later, they were there, outside the \
third-floor corridor \'97 and the door was already ajar. \
\
\'93Well, there you are,\'94 Harry said quietly, \'93Snape\'92s \
already got past Fluffy.\'94 \
\
Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress \
upon all three of them what was facing them. \
Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two. \
\
\'93If you want to go back, I won\'92t blame you,\'94 he said. \
\'93You can take the cloak, I won\'92t need it now.\'94 \
\
\'93Don\'92t be stupid,\'94 said Ron. \
\
Page | 308 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93We\'92re coming,\'94 said Hermione. \
\
Harry pushed the door open. \
\
As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their \
ears. All three of the dog\'92s noses sniffed madly in their \
direction, even though it couldn\'92t see them. \
\
\'93What\'92s that at its feet?\'94 Hermione whispered. \
\
\'93Looks like a harp,\'94 said Ron. \'93Snape must have left it \
there.\'94 \
\
\'93It must wake up the moment you stop playing,\'94 said \
Harry. \'93Well, here goes ...\'94 \
\
He put Hagrid\'92s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn\'92t \
really a tune, but from the first note the beast\'92s eyes \
began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the \
dog\'92s growls ceased \'97 it tottered on its paws and fell \
to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast \
asleep. \
\
\'93Keep playing,\'94 Ron warned Harry as they slipped out \
of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They \
could feel the dog\'92s hot, smelly breath as they \
approached the giant heads. \
\
\'93I think we\'92ll be able to pull the door open,\'94 said Ron, \
peering over the dog\'92s back. \'93Want to go first, \
Hermione?\'94 \
\
\'93No, I don\'92t!\'94 \
\
\'93All right.\'94 Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully \
over the dog\'92s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the \
trapdoor, which swung up and open. \
\
\'93What can you see?\'94 Hermione said anxiously. \
\
Page | 309 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Nothing \'97 just black \'97 there\'92s no way of climbing \
down, we\'92ll just have to drop.\'94 \
\
Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to \
get his attention and pointed at himself. \
\
\'93You want to go first? Are you sure?\'94 said Ron. \'93I \
don\'92t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to \
Hermione so she can keep him asleep.\'94 \
\
Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds\'92 \
silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the \
moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its \
deep sleep. \
\
Harry climbed over it and looked down through the \
trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom. \
\
He lowered himself through the hole until he was \
hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at \
Ron and said, \'93If anything happens to me, don\'92t \
follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to \
Dumbledore, right?\'94 \
\
\'93Right,\'94 said Ron. \
\
\'93See you in a minute, I hope. ...\'94 \
\
And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as \
he fell down, down, down and \'97 \
\
FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he \
landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, \
his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he \
was sitting on some sort of plant. \
\
\'93It\'92s okay!\'94 he called up to the light the size of a \
postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, \'93it\'92s a \
soft landing, you can jump!\'94 \
\
Page | 310 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to \
Harry. \
\
\'93What\'92s this stuff?\'94 were his first words. \
\
\'93Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it\'92s here \
to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!\'94 \
\
The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark \
from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She \
landed on Harry\'92s other side. \
\
\'93We must be miles under the school,\'94 she said. \
\
\'93Lucky this plant thing\'92s here, really,\'94 said Ron. \
\
\'93Lucky\\\'94 shrieked Hermione. \'93Look at you both!\'94 \
\
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She \
had to struggle because the moment she had landed, \
the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils \
around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs \
had already been bound tightly in long creepers \
without their noticing. \
\
Hermione had managed to free herself before the \
plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in \
horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off \
them, but the more they strained against it, the \
tighter and faster the plant wound around them. \
\
\'93Stop moving!\'94 Hermione ordered them. \'93I know what \
this is \'97 it\'92s Devil\'92s Snare!\'94 \
\
\'93Oh, I\'92m so glad we know what it\'92s called, that\'92s a \
great help,\'94 snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop \
the plant from curling around his neck. \
\
\
\
Page | 311 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Shut up, I\'92m trying to remember how to kill it!\'94 said \
Hermione. \
\
\'93Well, hurry up, I can\'92t breathe!\'94 Harry gasped, \
wrestling with it as it curled around his chest. \
\
\'93Devil\'92s Snare, Devil\'92s Snare ... what did Professor \
Sprout say? \'97 it likes the dark and the damp \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93So light a fire!\'94 Harry choked. \
\
\'93Yes \'97 of course \'97 but there\'92s no wood!\'94 Hermione \
cried, wringing her hands. \
\
\'93HAVE YOU GONE MAD?\'94 Ron bellowed. \'93ARE YOU A \
WITCH OR NOT?\'94 \
\
\'93Oh, right!\'94 said Hermione, and she whipped out her \
wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of \
the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at \
the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it \
loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light \
and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself \
from their bodies, and they were able to pull free. \
\
\'93Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\'94 \
said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat \
off his face. \
\
\'93Yeah,\'94 said Ron, \'93and lucky Harry doesn\'92t lose his \
head in a crisis \'97 \'91there\'92s no wood,\'92 honestly.\'94 \
\
\'93This way,\'94 said Harry, pointing down a stone \
passageway, which was the only way forward. \
\
All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the \
gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The \
passageway sloped downward, and Harry was \
reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the \
\
Page | 312 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
heart, he remembered the dragons said to be \
guarding vaults in the wizards\'92 bank. If they met a \
dragon, a fully-grown dragon \'97 Norbert had been bad \
enough ... \
\
\'93Can you hear something?\'94 Ron whispered. \
\
Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to \
be coming from up ahead. \
\
\'93Do you think it\'92s a ghost?\'94 \
\
\'93I don\'92t know ... sounds like wings to me.\'94 \
\
\'93There\'92s light ahead \'97 I can see something moving.\'94 \
\
They reached the end of the passageway and saw \
before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling \
arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel- \
bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the \
room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a \
heavy wooden door. \
\
\'93Do you think they\'92ll attack us if we cross the room?\'94 \
said Ron. \
\
\'93Probably,\'94 said Harry. \'93They don\'92t look very vicious, \
but I suppose if they all swooped down at once . . . \
well, there\'92s no other choice ... I\'92ll run.\'94 \
\
He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, \
and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel \
sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, \
but nothing happened. He reached the door \
untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked. \
\
The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved \
at the door, but it wouldn\'92t budge, not even when \
Hermione tried her Alohomora Charm. \
\
Page | 313 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Now what?\'94 said Ron. \
\
\
\
\'93These birds ... they can\'92t be here just for decoration,\'94 \
said Hermione. \
\
They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering \'97 \
glittering? \
\
\'93They\'92re not birds!\'94 Harry said suddenly. \'93They\'92re \
keys\\ Winged keys \'97 look carefully. So that must \
mean ...\'94 he looked around the chamber while the \
other two squinted up at the flock of keys. "... yes \'97 \
look! Broomsticks! We\'92ve got to catch the key to the \
door!\'94 \
\
\'93But there are hundreds of them!\'94 \
\
Ron examined the lock on the door. \
\
\'93We\'92re looking for a big, old-fashioned one \'97 probably \
silver, like the handle.\'94 \
\
They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the \
air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They \
grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted \
and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to \
catch one. \
\
Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest \
Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting \
things other people didn\'92t. After a minute\'92s weaving \
about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he \
noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it \
had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the \
keyhole. \
\
\'93That one!\'94 he called to the others. \'93That big one \'97 \
there \'97 no, there \'97 with bright blue wings \'97 the \
feathers are all crumpled on one side.\'94 \
\
Page | 314 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was \
pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off \
his broom. \
\
\'93We\'92ve got to close in on it!\'94 Harry called, not taking \
his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. \'93Ron, you \
come at it from above \'97 Hermione, stay below and \
stop it from going down \'97 and I\'92ll try and catch it. \
Right, NOW!\'94 \
\
Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key \
dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped \
toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a \
nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone \
with one hand. Ron and Hermione \'92s cheers echoed \
around the high chamber. \
\
They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the \
key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock \
and turned \'97 it worked. The moment the lock had \
clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very \
battered now that it had been caught twice. \
\
\'93Ready?\'94 Harry asked the other two, his hand on the \
door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open. \
\
The next chamber was so dark they couldn\'92t see \
anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light \
suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing \
sight. \
\
They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, \
behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than \
they were and carved from what looked like black \
stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were \
the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered \
slightly \'97 the towering white chessmen had no faces. \
\
\'93Now what do we do?\'94 Harry whispered. \
\
Page | 315 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93It\'92s obvious, isn\'92t it?\'94 said Ron. \'93We\'92ve got to play our \
way across the room.\'94 \
\
\
\
Behind the white pieces they could see another door. \
\
\'93How?\'94 said Hermione nervously. \
\
\'93I think,\'94 said Ron, \'93we\'92re going to have to be \
chessmen.\'94 \
\
He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out \
to touch the knights horse. At once, the stone sprang \
to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight \
turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron. \
\
\'93Do we \'97 er \'97 have to join you to get across?\'94 \
\
The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other \
two. \
\
\'93This needs thinking about. ...\'94 he said. \'93I suppose \
we\'92ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces. \
\
\
\
Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron \
think. Finally he said, \'93Now, don\'92t be offended or \
anything, but neither of you are that good at chess \'97 \
\
\
\
\'93We\'92re not offended,\'94 said Harry quickly. \'93Just tell us \
what to do.\'94 \
\
\'93Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and \
Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.\'94 \
\
\'93What about you?\'94 \
\
\'93I\'92m going to be a knight,\'94 said Ron. \
\
Page | 316 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because \
at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned \
their backs on the white pieces and walked off the \
board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, \
and Hermione took. \
\
\'93White always plays first in chess,\'94 said Ron, peering \
across the board. \'93Yes ... look ...\'94 \
\
A white pawn had moved forward two squares. \
\
Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved \
silently wherever he sent them. Harry\'92s knees were \
trembling. What if they lost? \
\
\'93Harry \'97 move diagonally four squares to the right.\'94 \
\
Their first real shock came when their other knight \
was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor \
and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite \
still, facedown. \
\
\'93Had to let that happen,\'94 said Ron, looking shaken. \
\'93Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go \
on.\'94 \
\
Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces \
showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp \
black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only \
just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in \
danger. He himself darted around the board, taking \
almost as many white pieces as they had lost black \
ones. \
\
\'93We\'92re nearly there,\'94 he muttered suddenly. \'93Let me \
think \'97 let me think ...\'94 \
\
The white queen turned her blank face toward him. \
\
\
\
Page | 317 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Yes ...\'94 said Ron softly, \'93it\'92s the only way ... I\'92ve got \
to be taken.\'94 \
\
\
\
\'93NO!\'94 Harry and Hermione shouted. \
\
\'93That\'92s chess!\'94 snapped Ron. \'93You\'92ve got to make \
some sacrifices! I make my move and she\'92ll take me \'97 \
that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!\'94 \
\
\'93But \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Do you want to stop Snape or not?\'94 \
\
\'93Ron \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Look, if you don\'92t hurry up, hell already have the \
Stone!\'94 \
\
There was no alternative. \
\
\'93Ready?\'94 Ron called, his face pale but determined. \
\'93Here I go \'97 now, don\'92t hang around once you\'92ve \
won.\'94 \
\
He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. \
She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone \
arm, and he crashed to the floor \'97 Hermione \
screamed but stayed on her square \'97 the white \
queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he\'92d \
been knocked out. \
\
Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left. \
\
The white king took off his crown and threw it at \
Harry\'92s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and \
bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last \
desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione \
charged through the door and up the next \
passageway. \
\
Page | 318 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93What if he\'92s \'97 ?\'94 \
\
\
\
\'93He\'92ll be all right,\'94 said Harry, trying to convince \
himself. \'93What do you reckon\'92s next?\'94 \
\
\'93We\'92ve had Sprout\'92s, that was the Devil\'92s Snare; \
Flitwick must\'92ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall \
transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that \
leaves Quirrell\'92s spell, and Snape\'92s ...\'94 \
\
They had reached another door. \
\
\'93All right?\'94 Harry whispered. \
\
\'93Go on.\'94 \
\
Harry pushed it open. \
\
A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of \
them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes \
watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a \
troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out \
cold with a bloody lump on its head. \
\
\'93I\'92m glad we didn\'92t have to fight that one,\'94 Harry \
whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its \
massive legs. \'93Come on, I can\'92t breathe.\'94 \
\
He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly \
daring to look at what came next \'97 but there was \
nothing very frightening in here, just a table with \
seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a \
line. \
\
\'93Snape\'92s,\'94 said Harry. \'93What do we have to do?\'94 \
\
They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a \
fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn\'92t \
ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same \
\
Page | 319 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading \
onward. They were trapped. \
\
\'93Look!\'94 Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to \
the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it: \
\
Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, \
\
Two of us will help you, whichever you would find, \
\
One among us seven will let you move ahead, \
\
Another will transport the drinker back instead, \
\
Two among our number hold only nettle wine, \
\
Three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line. \
\
Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, \
\
To help you in your choice, we give you these clues \
four: \
\
First, however slyly the poison tries to hide \
\
You will always find some on nettle wine\'92s left side; \
\
Second, different are those who stand at either end, \
\
But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; \
\
Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, \
\
Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; \
\
Fourth, the second left and the second on the right \
\
Are twins once you taste them, though different at first \
sight \
\
Page | 320 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw \
that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like \
doing. \
\
\'93Brilliant,\'94 said Hermione. \'93This isn\'92t magic \'97 it\'92s \
logic \'97 a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven\'92t \
got an ounce of logic, they\'92d be stuck in here forever.\'94 \
\
\'93But so will we, won\'92t we?\'94 \
\
\'93Of course not,\'94 said Hermione. \'93Everything we need \
is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; \
two are wine; one will get us safely through the black \
fire, and one will get us back through the purple.\'94 \
\
\'93But how do we know which to drink?\'94 \
\
\'93Give me a minute.\'94 \
\
Hermione read the paper several times. Then she \
walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to \
herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her \
hands. \
\
\'93Got it,\'94 she said. \'93The smallest bottle will get us \
through the black fire \'97 toward the Stone.\'94 \
\
Harry looked at the tiny bottle. \
\
\'93There\'92s only enough there for one of us,\'94 he said. \
\'93That\'92s hardly one swallow.\'94 \
\
They looked at each other. \
\
\'93Which one will get you back through the purple \
flames?\'94 \
\
Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end \
of the line. \
\

\
\
\
\
\'93You drink that,\'94 said Harry. \'93No, listen, get back and \
get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, \
they\'92ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy \'97 \
go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to \
Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold \
Snape off for a while, but I\'92m no match for him, \
really.\'94 \
\
\'93But Harry \'97 what if You-Know- Who\'92s with him?\'94 \
\
\'93Well \'97 I was lucky once, wasn\'92t I?\'94 said Harry, \
pointing at his scar. \'93I might get lucky again.\'94 \
\
Hermione\'92s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at \
Harry and threw her arms around him. \
\
\'93Hermionel\'94 \
\
\'93Harry \'97 you\'92re a great wizard, you know.\'94 \
\
\'93I\'92m not as good as you,\'94 said Harry, very \
embarrassed, as she let go of him. \
\
\'93Me!\'94 said Hermione. \'93Books! And cleverness! There \
are more important things \'97 friendship and bravery \
and \'97 oh Harry \'97 be carefull\'94 \
\
\'93You drink first,\'94 said Harry. \'93You are sure which is \
which, aren\'92t you?\'94 \
\
\'93Positive,\'94 said Hermione. She took a long drink from \
the round bottle at the end, and shuddered. \
\
\'93It\'92s not poison?\'94 said Harry anxiously. \
\
\'93No \'97 but it\'92s like ice.\'94 \
\
\'93Quick, go, before it wears off.\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 322 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Good luck \'97 take care \'97 \'94 \
\
\
\
\'93GO!\'94 \
\
Hermione turned and walked straight through the \
purple fire. \
\
Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest \
bottle. He turned to face the black flames. \
\
\'93Here I come,\'94 he said, and he drained the little bottle \
in one gulp. \
\
It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He \
put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced \
himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but \
couldn\'92t feel them \'97 for a moment he could see \
nothing but dark fire \'97 then he was on the other \
side, in the last chamber. \
\
There was already someone there \'97 but it wasn\'92t \
Snape. It wasn\'92t even Voldemort. \
\
\
\

\
\
\
\
\
THE MAN WITH TWO FACES \
\
It was Quirrell. \
\
\'93You\\\'94 gasped Harry. \
\
Quirrell smiled. His face wasn\'92t twitching at all. \
\
\'93Me,\'94 he said calmly. \'93I wondered whether I\'92d be \
meeting you here, Potter.\'94 \
\
\'93But I thought \'97 Snape \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Severus?\'94 Quirrell laughed, and it wasn\'92t his usual \
quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. \'93Yes, \
Severus does seem the type, doesn\'92t he? So useful to \
have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. \
\
Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st- \
stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?\'94 \
\
Harry couldn\'92t take it in. This couldn\'92t be true, it \
couldn\'92t. \
\
\'93But Snape tried to kill me!\'94 \
\
Page | 324 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\'93No, no, no. / tried to kill you. Your friend Miss \
Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed \
to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She \
broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds \
and I\'92d have got you off that broom. I\'92d have managed \
it before then if Snape hadn\'92t been muttering a \
countercurse, trying to save you.\'94 \
\
\'93Snape was trying to save me?\'94 \
\
\'93Of course,\'94 said Quirrell coolly. \'93Why do you think \
he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying \
to make sure I didn\'92t do it again. Funny, really ... he \
needn\'92t have bothered. I couldn\'92t do anything with \
Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought \
Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he \
did make himself unpopular . . . and what a waste of \
time, when after all that, I\'92m going to kill you tonight.\'94 \
\
Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin \
air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry. \
\
\'93You\'92re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the \
school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you\'92d \
seen me coming to look at what was guarding the \
Stone.\'94 \
\
\'93 You let the troll in?\'94 \
\
\'93Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls \'97 you must \
have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back \
there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was \
running around looking for it, Snape, who already \
suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head \
me off \'97 and not only did my troll fail to beat you to \
death, that three-headed dog didn\'92t even manage to \
bite Snape \'92s leg off properly. \
\
\
\
Page | 325 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this \
interesting mirror.\'94 \
\
It was only then that Harry realized what was \
standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised. \
\
\'93This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\'94 Quirrell \
murmured, tapping his way around the frame. \'93Trust \
Dumbledore to come up with something like this . . . \
but he\'92s in London ... I\'92ll be far away by the time he \
gets back. ...\'94 \
\
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell \
talking and stop him from concentrating on the \
mirror. \
\
\'93I saw you and Snape in the forest \'97 \'94 he blurted out. \
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to \
look at the back. \'93He was on to me by that time, \
trying to find out how far I\'92d got. He suspected me all \
along. Tried to frighten me \'97 as though he could, \
when I had Lord Voldemort on my side. ...\'94 \
\
Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and \
stared hungrily into it. \
\
\'93I see the Stone ... I\'92m presenting it to my master ... \
but where is it?\'94 \
\
Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but \
they didn\'92t give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving \
his whole attention to the mirror. \
\
\'93But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\'94 \
\
\'93Oh, he does,\'94 said Quirrell casually, \'93heavens, yes. \
He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn\'92t you \
\
\
\
Page | 326 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted \
you dead.\'94 \
\
\'93But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing \'97 I thought \
Snape was threatening you. \
\
For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across \
Quirrell\'92s face. \
\
\'93Sometimes,\'94 he said, \'93I find it hard to follow my \
master\'92s instructions \'97 he is a great wizard and I am \
weak \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93You mean he was there in the classroom with you?\'94 \
Harry gasped. \
\
\'93He is with me wherever I go,\'94 said Quirrell quietly. \'93I \
met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish \
young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about \
good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong \
I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, \
and those too weak to seek it. ... Since then, I have \
served him faithfully, although I have let him down \
many times. He has had to be very hard on me.\'94 \
Quirrell shivered suddenly. \'93He does not forgive \
mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the Stone from \
Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me \
. . . decided he would have to keep a closer watch on \
me. ...\'94 \
\
Quirrell\'92s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering \
his trip to Diagon Alley \'97 how could he have been so \
stupid? He\'92d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken \
hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron. \
\
Quirrell cursed under his breath. \
\
\'93I don\'92t understand ... is the Stone inside the mirror? \
Should I break it?\'94 \
\
Page | 327 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Harry\'92s mind was racing. \
\
\
\
What I want more than anything else in the world at \
the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before \
Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see \
my self finding it \'97 which means I\'92ll see where it\'92s \
hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing \
what I\'92m up to? \
\
He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass \
without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his \
ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell \
ignored him. He was still talking to himself. \
\
\'93What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help \
me, Master!\'94 \
\
And to Harry\'92s horror, a voice answered, and the voice \
seemed to come from Quirrell himself. \
\
\'93Use the boy ... Use the boy ...\'94 \
\
Quirrell rounded on Harry. \
\
\'93Yes \'97 Potter \'97 come here.\'94 \
\
He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding \
Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet. \
\
\'93Come here,\'94 Quirrell repeated. \'93Look in the mirror \
and tell me what you see.\'94 \
\
Harry walked toward him. \
\
I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie \
about what I see, that\'92s all. \
\
Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in \
the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell\'92s \
\

\
\
\
\
turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the \
mirror, and opened them again. \
\
He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. \
But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It \
put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood- \
red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its \
pocket \'97 and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy \
drop into his real pocket. Somehow \'97 incredibly \'97 \
he\'92d gotten the Stone. \
\
\'93Well?\'94 said Quirrell impatiently. \'93What do you see?\'94 \
Harry screwed up his courage. \
\
\'93I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,\'94 he \
invented. \'93I \'97 I\'92ve won the House Cup for Gryffindor.\'94 \
\
Quirrell cursed again. \
\
\'93Get out of the way,\'94 he said. As Harry moved aside, \
he felt the Sorcerer\'92s Stone against his leg. Dare he \
make a break for it? \
\
But he hadn\'92t walked five paces before a high voice \
spoke, though Quirrell wasn\'92t moving his lips. \
\
\'93He lies ... He lies ...\'94 \
\
\'93Potter, come back here!\'94 Quirrell shouted. \'93Tell me \
the truth! What did you just see?\'94 \
\
The high voice spoke again. \
\
\'93Let me speak to him ... face-to-face. ...\'94 \
\
\'93Master, you are not strong enough!\'94 \
\
\'93I have strength enough ... for this. ...\'94 \
\
Page | 329 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Harry felt as if Devil\'92s Snare was rooting him to the \
spot. He couldn\'92t move a muscle. Petrified, he \
watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap \
his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. \
Quirrell\'92s head looked strangely small without it. \
\
Then he turned slowly on the spot. \
\
Harry would have screamed, but he couldn\'92t make a \
sound. Where there should have been a back to \
Quirrell\'92s head, there was a face, the most terrible \
face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with \
glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake. \
\
\'93Harry Potter ...\'94 it whispered. \
\
Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs \
wouldn\'92t move. \
\
\'93See what I have become?\'94 the face said. \'93Mere \
shadow and vapor ... I have form only when I can \
share another\'92s body . . . but there have always been \
those willing to let me into their hearts and minds. ... \
Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks \
. . . you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the \
forest ... and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be \
able to create a body of my own. ... Now ... why don\'92t \
you give me that Stone in your pocket?\'94 \
\
So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into \
Harry\'92s legs. He stumbled backward. \
\
\'93Don\'92t be a fool,\'94 snarled the face. \'93Better save your \
own life and join me ... or you\'92ll meet the same end as \
your parents. ... They died begging me for mercy. ...\'94 \
\
\'93LIAR!\'94 Harry shouted suddenly. \
\
\
\
Page | 330 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that \
Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now \
smiling. \
\
\'93How touching ...\'94 it hissed. \'93I always value bravery. \
\
... Yes, boy, your parents were brave. ... I killed your \
father first, and he put up a courageous fight . . . but \
your mother needn\'92t have died ... she was trying to \
protect you. ... Now give me the Stone, unless you \
want her to have died in vain.\'94 \
\
\'93NEVER!\'94 \
\
Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort \
screamed \'93SEIZE HIM!\'94 and the next second, Harry \
felt Quirrell\'92s hand close on his wrist. At once, a \
needle-sharp pain seared across Harry\'92s scar; his \
head felt as though it was about to split in two; he \
yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his \
surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head \
lessened \'97 he looked around wildly to see where \
Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, \
looking at his fingers \'97 they were blistering before his \
eyes. \
\
\'93Seize him! SEIZE HIM!\'94 shrieked Voldemort again, \
and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, \
landing on top of him, both hands around Harry\'92s \
neck \'97 Harry\'92s scar was almost blinding him with \
pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony. \
\
\'93Master, I cannot hold him \'97 my hands \'97 my \
hands!\'94 \
\
And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground \
with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, \
bewildered, at his own palms \'97 Harry could see they \
looked burned, raw, red, and shiny. \
\
\
\
Page | 331 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Then kill him, fool, and be done!\'94 screeched \
Voldemort. \
\
Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, \
but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed \
Quirrell\'92s face \'97 \
\
\'93AAAARGH!\'94 \
\
Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and \
then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn\'92t touch his bare \
skin, not without suffering terrible pain \'97 his only \
chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in \
enough pain to stop him from doing a curse. \
\
Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, \
and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed \
and tried to throw Harry off \'97 the pain in Harry\'92s \
head was building \'97 he couldn\'92t see \'97 he could only \
hear Quirrell\'92s terrible shrieks and Voldemort\'92s yells \
of, \'93KILL HIM! KILL HIM!\'94 and other voices, maybe in \
Harry\'92s own head, crying, \'93Harry! Harry!\'94 \
\
He felt Quirrell\'92s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew \
all was lost, and fell into blackness, down ... down ... \
down ... \
\
Something gold was glinting just above him. The \
Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too \
heavy. \
\
He blinked. It wasn\'92t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of \
glasses. How strange. \
\
He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus \
Dumbledore swam into view above him. \
\
\'93Good afternoon, Harry,\'94 said Dumbledore. \
\
\
\
Page | 332 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: \'93Sir! The \
Stone! It was Quirrell! He\'92s got the Stone! Sir, quick \'97 \
\
\
\
\'93Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the \
times,\'94 said Dumbledore. \'93Quirrell does not have the \
Stone.\'94 \
\
\'93Then who does? Sir, I \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me \
thrown out.\'94 \
\
Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized \
he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed \
with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table \
piled high with what looked like half the candy shop. \
\
\'93Tokens from your friends and admirers,\'94 said \
Dumbledore, beaming. \'93What happened down in the \
dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a \
complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school \
knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George \
Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a \
toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse \
you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be \
very hygienic, and confiscated it.\'94 \
\
\'93How long have I been in here?\'94 \
\
\'93Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger \
will be most relieved you have come round, they have \
been extremely worried.\'94 \
\
\'93But sir, the Stone \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the \
Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it \
\
\
\
Page | 333 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although \
you were doing very well on your own, I must say.\'94 \
\
\'93You got there? You got Hermione\'92s owl?\'94 \
\
\'93We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I \
reached London than it became clear to me that the \
place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived \
just in time to pull Quirrell off you \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93It was you.\'94 \
\
\'93I feared I might be too late.\'94 \
\
\'93You nearly were, I couldn\'92t have kept him off the \
Stone much longer \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Not the Stone, boy, you \'97 the effort involved nearly \
killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid \
it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.\'94 \
\
\'93Destroyed?\'94 said Harry blankly. \'93But your friend \'97 \
Nicolas Flamel \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Oh, you know about Nicolas?\'94 said Dumbledore, \
sounding quite delighted. \'93You did do the thing \
properly, didn\'92t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a \
little chat, and agreed it\'92s all for the best.\'94 \
\
\'93But that means he and his wife will die, won\'92t they?\'94 \
\
\'93They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in \
order and then, yes, they will die.\'94 \
\
Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on \
Harry\'92s face. \
\
\'93To one as young as you, I\'92m sure it seems incredible, \
but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to \
\
Page | 334 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well- \
organized mind, death is but the next great \
adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a \
wonderful thing. As much money and life as you \
could want! The two things most human beings would \
choose above all \'97 the trouble is, humans do have a \
knack of choosing precisely those things that are \
worst for them.\'94 \
\
Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed \
a little and smiled at the ceiling. \
\
\'93Sir?\'94 said Harry. \'93I\'92ve been thinking ... Sir \'97 even if \
the Stone\'92s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper \
name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the \
thing itself.\'94 \
\
\'93Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort\'92s going to try other ways of \
coming back, isn\'92t he? I mean, he hasn\'92t gone, has \
he?\'94 \
\
\'93No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there \
somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to \
share ... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He \
left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his \
followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while \
you may only have delayed his return to power, it will \
merely take someone else who is prepared to fight \
what seems a losing battle next time \'97 and if he is \
delayed again, and again, why, he may never return \
to power.\'94 \
\
Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made \
his head hurt. Then he said, \'93Sir, there are some \
other things I\'92d like to know, if you can tell me ... \
things I want to know the truth about. ...\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 335 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93The truth.\'94 Dumbledore sighed. \'93It is a beautiful and \
terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with \
great caution. However, I shall answer your questions \
unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case \
I beg you 11 forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.\'94 \
\
\'93Well ... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother \
because she tried to stop him from killing me. But \
why would he want to kill me in the first place?\'94 \
\
Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time. \
\
\'93Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. \
\
Not today. Not now. You will know, one day ... put it \
from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older . . . \
I know you hate to hear this . . . when you are ready, \
you will know.\'94 \
\
And Harry knew it would be no good to argue. \
\
\'93But why couldn\'92t Quirrell touch me?\'94 \
\
\'93Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing \
Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn\'92t \
realize that love as powerful as your mother\'92s for you \
leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign ... to \
have been loved so deeply, even though the person \
who loved us is gone, will give us some protection \
forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, \
greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, \
could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to \
touch a person marked by something so good.\'94 \
\
Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out \
on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his \
eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, \
Harry said, \'93And the Invisibility Cloak \'97 do you know \
who sent it to me?\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 336 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Ah \'97 your father happened to leave it in my \
possession, and I thought you might like it.\'94 \
Dumbledore\'92s eyes twinkled. \'93Useful things ... your \
father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens \
to steal food when he was here.\'94 \
\
\'93And there\'92s something else ...\'94 \
\
\'93Fire away.\'94 \
\
\'93Quirrell said Snape \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93Professor Snape, Harry.\'94 \
\
\'93Yes, him \'97 Quirrell said he hates me because he \
hated my father. Is that true?\'94 \
\
\'93Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike \
yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did \
something Snape could never forgive.\'94 \
\
\'93What?\'94 \
\
\'93He saved his life.\'94 \
\
\'93What?\'94 \
\
\'93Yes ...\'94 said Dumbledore dreamily. \'93Funny, the way \
people\'92s minds work, isn\'92t it? Professor Snape \
couldn\'92t bear being in your father\'92s debt. ... I do \
believe he worked so hard to protect you this year \
because he felt that would make him and your father \
even. Then he could go back to hating your father\'92s \
memory in peace. ...\'94 \
\
Harry tried to understand this but it made his head \
pound, so he stopped. \
\
\'93And sir, there\'92s one more thing ...\'94 \
\
Page | 337 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Just the one?\'94 \
\
\
\
\'93How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?\'94 \
\
\'93Ah, now, I\'92m glad you asked me that. It was one of \
my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, \
that\'92s saying something. You see, only one who \
wanted to find the Stone \'97 find it, but not use it \'97 \
would be able to get it, otherwise they\'92d just see \
themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My \
brain surprises even me sometimes. ... Now, enough \
questions. I suggest you make a start on these \
sweets. Ah! Bertie Bott\'92s Every Flavor Beans! I was \
unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a \
vomit-flavored one, and since then I\'92m afraid I\'92ve \
rather lost my liking for them \'97 but I think I\'92ll be safe \
with a nice toffee, don\'92t you?\'94 \
\
He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his \
mouth. Then he choked and said, \'93Alas! Ear wax!\'94 \
\
Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but \
very strict. \
\
\'93Just five minutes,\'94 Harry pleaded. \
\
\'93Absolutely not.\'94 \
\
\'93You let Professor Dumbledore in. ...\'94 \
\
\'93Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite \
different. You need rest.\'94 \
\
\'93I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go \
on, Madam Pomfrey ...\'94 \
\
\'93Oh, very well,\'94 she said. \'93But five minutes only.\'94 \
\
And she let Ron and Hermione in. \
\
Page | 338 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Harryl\'94 \
\
\
\
Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him \
again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his \
head was still very sore. \
\
\'93Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to \'97 \
Dumbledore was so worried \'97 \'94 \
\
\'93The whole school\'92s talking about it,\'94 said Ron. \'93What \
really happened?\'94 \
\
It was one of those rare occasions when the true story \
is even more strange and exciting than the wild \
rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the \
mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione \
were a very good audience; they gasped in all the \
right places, and when Harry told them what was \
under Quirrell\'92s turban, Hermione screamed out loud. \
\
\'93So the Stone\'92s gone?\'94 said Ron finally. \'93Flamel\'92s just \
going to die?\'94 \
\
\'93That\'92s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that \'97 \
what was it? \'97 \'91to the well-organized mind, death is \
but the next great adventure.\'92 \'94 \
\
\'93I always said he was off his rocker,\'94 said Ron, \
looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was. \
\
\'93So what happened to you two?\'94 said Harry. \
\
\'93Well, I got back all right,\'94 said Hermione. \'93I brought \
Ron round \'97 that took a while \'97 and we were \
dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when \
we met him in the entrance hall \'97 he already knew \'97 \
he just said, \'91Harry\'92s gone after him, hasn\'92t he?\'92 and \
hurtled off to the third floor.\'94 \
\
Page | 339 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93D\'92you think he meant you to do it?\'94 said Ron. \
\'93Sending you your fathers cloak and everything?\'94 \
\
\'93Well,\'94 Hermione exploded, \'93if he did \'97 I mean to say \
\'97 that\'92s terrible \'97 you could have been killed.\'94 \
\
\'93No, it isn\'92t,\'94 said Harry thoughtfully. \'93He\'92s a funny \
man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give \
me a chance. I think he knows more or less \
everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he \
had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and \
instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to \
help. I don\'92t think it was an accident he let me find \
out how the mirror worked. It\'92s almost like he thought \
I had the right to face Voldemort if I could. ...\'94 \
\
\'93Yeah, Dumbledore\'92s off his rocker, all right,\'94 said \
Ron proudly. \'93Listen, you\'92ve got to be up for the end- \
of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and \
Slytherin won, of course \'97 you missed the last \
Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by \
Ravenclaw without you \'97 but the food\'92ll be good.\'94 \
\
At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over. \
\
\'93You\'92ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,\'94 she \
said firmly. \
\
\
\
\'95k k k \
\
\
\
After a good night\'92s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to \
normal. \
\
\'93I want to go to the feast,\'94 he told Madam Pomfrey as \
she straightened his many candy boxes. \'93I can, can\'92t \
I?\'94 \
\
\
\
Page | 340 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to \
go,\'94 she said sniffily, as though in her opinion \
Professor Dumbledore didn\'92t realize how risky feasts \
could be. \'93And you have another visitor.\'94 \
\
\'93Oh, good,\'94 said Harry. \'93Who is it?\'94 \
\
Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual \
when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be \
allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at \
him, and burst into tears. \
\
\'93It\'92s \'97 all \'97 my \'97 ruddy \'97 fault!\'94 he sobbed, his \
face in his hands. \'93I told the evil git how ter get past \
Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn\'92t \
know, an\'92 I told him! Yeh could\'92ve died! All fer a \
dragon egg! I\'92ll never drink again! I should be chucked \
out an\'92 made ter live as a Muggle!\'94 \
\
\'93Hagrid!\'94 said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking \
with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into \
his beard. \'93Hagrid, he\'92d have found out somehow, \
this is Voldemort we\'92re talking about, he\'92d have found \
out even if you hadn\'92t told him.\'94 \
\
\'93Yeh could\'92ve died!\'94 sobbed Hagrid. \'93An\'92 don\'92 say the \
name!\'94 \
\
\'93VOLDEMORT!\'94 Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so \
shocked, he stopped crying. \'93I\'92ve met him and I\'92m \
calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we \
saved the Stone, it\'92s gone, he can\'92t use it. Have a \
Chocolate Frog, I\'92ve got loads. ...\'94 \
\
Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and \
said, \'93That reminds me. I\'92ve got yeh a present.\'94 \
\
\'93It\'92s not a stoat sandwich, is it?\'94 said Harry \
anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle. \
\
Page | 341 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter \
fix it. \'92Course, he shoulda sacked me instead \'97 \
anyway, got y eh this ...\'94 \
\
It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. \
Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard \
photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every \
page were his mother and father. \
\
\'93Sent owls off ter all yer parents\'92 old school friends, \
askin\'92 fer photos ... knew yeh didn\'92 have any ... d\'92yeh \
like it?\'94 \
\
Harry couldn\'92t speak, but Hagrid understood. \
\
Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast \
alone that night. He had been held up by Madam \
Pomfrey\'92s fussing about, insisting on giving him one \
last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It \
was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and \
silver to celebrate Slytherin \'92s winning the House Cup \
for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing \
the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the \
High Table. \
\
When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and \
then everybody started talking loudly at once. He \
slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the \
Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that \
people were standing up to look at him. \
\
Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The \
babble died away. \
\
\'93Another year gone!\'94 Dumbledore said cheerfully. \
\
\'93And I must trouble you with an old man\'92s wheezing \
waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious \
feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads \
are all a little fuller than they were . . . you have the \
Page | 342 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty \
before next year starts. ... \
\
\'93Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs \
awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, \
Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in \
third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; \
Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and \
Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.\'94 \
\
A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the \
Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging \
his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight. \
\
\'93Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,\'94 said Dumbledore. \
\'93However, recent events must be taken into account.\'94 \
\
The room went very still. The Slytherins\'92 smiles faded \
a little. \
\
\'93Ahem,\'94 said Dumbledore. \'93I have a few last-minute \
points to dish out. Let me see. Yes ... \
\
\'93First \'97 to Mr. Ronald Weasley ...\'94 \
\
Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish \
with a bad sunburn. \
\
"... for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has \
seen in many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty \
points.\'94 \
\
Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; \
the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be \
heard telling the other prefects, \'93My brother, you \
know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall\'92s \
giant chess set!\'94 \
\
At last there was silence again. \
\
Page | 343 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
\'93Second \'97 to Miss Hermione Granger . . . for the use of \
cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House \
fifty points.\'94 \
\
Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly \
suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up \
and down the table were beside themselves \'97 they \
were a hundred points up. \
\
\'93Third \'97 to Mr. Harry Potter ...\'94 said Dumbledore. \
\
The room went deadly quiet. "... for pure nerve and \
outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty \
points.\'94 \
\
The din was deafening. Those who could add up while \
yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now \
had four hundred and seventy-two points \'97 exactly \
the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the House \
Cup \'97 if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one \
more point. \
\
Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell \
silent. \
\
\'93There are all kinds of courage,\'94 said Dumbledore, \
smiling. \'93It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up \
to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our \
friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville \
Longbottom.\'94 \
\
Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well \
have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, \
so loud was the noise that erupted from the \
Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up \
to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, \
disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He \
had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor \
before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs \
and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn\'92t have looked more \
Page | 344 Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone - J.K. Rowling \
\
\
\
\
stunned and horrified if he\'92d just had the Body-Bind \
Curse put on him. \
\
\'93Which means,\'94 Dumbledore called over the storm of \
applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were \
celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \'93we need a little \
change of decoration.\'94 \
\
He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green \
hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; \
the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering \
Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking \
Professor McGonagall\'92s hand, with a horrible, forced \
smile. He caught Harry\'92s eye and Harry knew at once \
that Snape \'92s feelings toward him hadn\'92t changed one \
jot. This didn\'92t worry Harry. It seemed as though life \
would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it \
ever was at Hogwarts. \
\
It was the best evening of Harry\'92s life, better than \
winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out \
mountain trolls ... he would never, ever forget tonight. \
\
Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results \
were still to come, but come they did. To their great \
surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; \
Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first \
years. Even Neville scraped through, his good \
Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions \
one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as \
stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he \
had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you \
couldn\'92t have everything in life. \
\
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their \
trunks were packed, Neville\'92s toad was found lurking \
in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all \
students, warning them not to use magic over the \
holidays (\'93I always hope they\'92ll forget to give us \

\
\
these,\'94 said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to \
take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across \
the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; \
talking and laughing as the countryside became \
greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott\'92s Every Flavor \
Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off \
their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; \
pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at \
King\'92s Cross station. \
\
It took quite a while for them all to get off the \
platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket \
barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and \
threes so they didn\'92t attract attention by all bursting \
out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles. \
\
\'93You must come and stay this summer,\'94 said Ron, \
\'93both of you \'97 I\'92ll send you an owl.\'94 \
\
\'93Thanks,\'94 said Harry, \'93I\'92ll need something to look \
forward to.\'94 \
\
People jostled them as they moved forward toward the \
gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them \
called: \
\
\'93Bye, Harry!\'94 \
\
\'93See you, Potter!\'94 \
\
\'93Still famous,\'94 said Ron, grinning at him. \
\
\'93Not where I\'92m going, I promise you,\'94 said Harry. \
\
He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway \
together. \
\
\'93There he is, Mom, there he is, look!\'94 \
\
\
\

\
\
\
\
It was Ginny Weasley, Ron\'92s younger sister, but she \
wasn\'92t pointing at Ron. \
\
\'93Harry Potter!\'94 she squealed. \'93Look, Mom! I can see \
\'93Be quiet, Ginny, and it\'92s rude to point.\'94 \
\
Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them. \
\
\'93Busy year?\'94 she said. \
\
\'93Very,\'94 said Harry. \'93Thanks for the fudge and the \
sweater, Mrs. Weasley.\'94 \
\
\'93Oh, it was nothing, dear.\'94 \
\
\'93Ready, are you?\'94 \
\
It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still \
mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, \
carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary \
people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, \
looking terrified at the very sight of Harry. \
\
\'93You must be Harry\'92s family!\'94 said Mrs. Weasley. \
\
\'93In a manner of speaking,\'94 said Uncle Vernon. \'93Hurry \
up, boy, we haven\'92t got all day.\'94 He walked away. \
\
Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and \
Hermione. \
\
\'93See you over the summer, then.\'94 \
\
\'93Hope you have \'97 er \'97 a good holiday,\'94 said \
Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, \
shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant. \
\
\
\

\
\
\
\
\'93Oh, I will,\'94 said Harry, and they were surprised at \
the grin that was spreading over his face. \'93 They don\'92t \
know we\'92re not allowed to use magic at home. I\'92m \
going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer...\'94 \
